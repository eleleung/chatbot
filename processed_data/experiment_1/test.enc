Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
There.
Sure have.
Hi.
Have fun tonight?
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
Well, no...
Then that's all you had to say.
What good stuff?
The "real you".
I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  And you don't know how to quit?
Is he oily or dry?
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
It's more
Queen Harry?
Hey, sweet cheeks.
Where've you been?
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
Like you care.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
What?
In 9th.  For a month
He was, like, a total babe
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
You set me up.
I just wanted --
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
And where're you going?
Oh, God.  It's starting.
Daddy, no!
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
You the new guy?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Get out!
That girl -- I --
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
I thought you hated those people.
You got him involved?
Will Bogey get bent?
Number one.  She hates smokers
You told me that part already.
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
Cameron, I'm a little busy
What's the worst?
Yeah
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
I just upped my price
Forget it.
How'd you do it?
We don't chat.
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
He always look so
What's this?
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
That's never been proven
You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
You didn't
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
Pick you up Friday, then
You hate me don't you?
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
You -- covered in my vomit.
Okay?
You're not okay.
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
This is so patronizing.
Why 're you doing this?
You don't care if I die
Why?
Kat! Wake up!
Busy
Were you in jail?
No, you weren't
Then why'd you ask?
Do what?
Start a band?
Oh, so now you think you know me?
So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.
What are you doing here?
I heard there was a poetry reading.
Unwelcome.
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
C'mon.  It's not that bad
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
How?
No one else knows
Is that a request or a command?
No what?
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
What?
Wait I...
I know.
As a parent, that's my right
So what I want doesn't matter?
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?
Macbeth, right?
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
Ever been to Club Skunk?
I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
We should have seen land.
You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
You can see for yourself.
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
I could be gone for years.
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
May I ask by whom?
How far from here?
Father...
What are you listening to?
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
What...?  Do I have so many already?
I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
What do you see?
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
Say not here!  Cuba!
We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?
He understands.
You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!
How did you manage it?
Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
How can you be so certain?
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
I am listening, my son.
I believed in you...
May I speak freely?
But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent.
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
Six days ago, yes.
You must be mad...!
You think I don't know that?
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
You bloody...
You tell that to them!
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
Then why?
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
You bring the cigarettes?
I was all of these.
What about Oleg?
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
What's your cut?  How much?
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
What else do you need?
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
I'm abused.  Don't you think?
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
Now I become custody of police department?
I will if they don't send me back.
Are you married?
Divorced.
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
So...the station is empty?
Yes, I considered it.
What about back home?
I know.
They're not gonna send you right back.
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
I let her take a shower.
No!  Nothing happened.
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
Yeah, right.
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
Vodka tonic.
I'm gonna propose.
When?
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
Where is she?
Yeah.
Are you hit?
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
What are you saying?
No, what is it?
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
I don't even watch TV.
Hmmmm.
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
I'll come with you.
My folks are.
This has nothing to do with your fire.
I'll let you know what happens.
This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
I'm on duty.
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid
Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get, they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her.
My point exactly.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
What do you want?
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Alright?
Hey, honey.
What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh...
You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
Could be Leon's.
Answer the phone.
Answer it.
Promise?
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
You promise?
Yeah.  I promise.
See you later.  Good luck.
How old are your kids?
He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle.
Ready?
Keep them out of my way.
Okay.  You ready?
Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that.  And what kind of work do you do?
And what do you do with the bones?
Are you married?
Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
Tell him to put his gun down!
Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure.  Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser.
It's an outcall service run out of an apartment.  I don't meet the other girls.  Aren't you gonna get undressed?
Where is escort service?
Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just give me the address and then you go.
Next.  Could I see your documents, please?
Yes.
Is there a problem?
We are both from Prague.
Who is he?
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.
Don't fool around.
Did you hear what I said?
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
What is that?
Let me get a shot of it.
Sit down!
Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!
I'm serious.
This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'
Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
No, I don't get that!
Traitor!!
We spent it!
Ha. Ha.
A job?
It's easy to learn.
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself.
What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
Well, he...
Alright.  Go ahead.
That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
I'm here for movies.
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
What was that?
No way!  He's mine!
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you happy?
You okay?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
Oh yeah, why?
Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
How long they been livin' here?
Aren't you tired?
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
We're in negotiations, that's correct.
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?

Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
What's up?
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
I suppose the idea was specialized training.
Oh?
That seems very unlikely.
Yes, I thought so.
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
You're kidding.
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Yes, it is, Hal.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.

Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
How many days until you come home?
Yes, Daddy.
Thank you.
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
And your charming little daughter?
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Yes, very pleasant.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
That's right.
Certainly.
Any clue as to what it is?
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
When do we arrive at Clavius?
Thank you.
Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
True.
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
Five by five, Frank.
I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.
Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
Yeah?
Name?
This is three years old.
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
I ain't tired yet.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
No chance.
After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
You're done.  End of story.
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
Bullshit.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
Hey, this works pretty good.
Thank you.
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
I don't give out the details.
Last night.
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
You made that move, huh?
There.
Let's go.
This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
They saved your ass, convict.
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
You gonna let me keep any of it?
Right, partner.
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
That was in style a couple years back, man.
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the "Don't Disturb" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.
Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.
Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
Yeah...
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
Jack?
Yeah?
What the bell happened?
Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
Who are all these?
Tell me that's not the same guy.
I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
I got to wait for a call.
I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
What am I wanted for?
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
Hey, you're right.
You're hopeless.
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
Hey, you know what I really think?
You sure you want me to?
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
Jack, wait...
Hi, it's me...
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
You real down?
Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
How do you know?
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
Hard man to live with.
How would you know?
Shut up.
What do you want?  What's goin' on?
Stall.
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
When?
You chickenshit punk...
Rosalie, you okay?
This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
Give it back.
Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
...would you like a drink?
She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.
That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
I brought the girl remember?
You noticed...
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
So you do know her.
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
What kind of mission?
We have to save the world.
What are you doing?
When is she not in trouble?
Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
What are we going to do?
It's a miracle!!!
What is?
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?
What's she doing?
There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names...
They really made her...
Who?
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
Uh... at least fifty.
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
...Hello?
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
Yeah?
Have you pulled yourself together?
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
30 seconds...
6... 5...
My main man! Please don't leave me here alone. My head's killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta here!
Yeah, very big, a giant.
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
Six to the left. One to the right.
You know how to fly this thing?
What did you say? What did you do?
Where have I heard this song before?
Just one... why me?
I've had enough good news for today
It's my wife.
Cornelius..
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
I told you not to read all that crap!
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
Tell me...
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
The cash man!
Thanks..
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
I want your best man on this!
Options.
Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..
Drink!
Yes, Sir!
Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?
What's this... have you been smoking... ?
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
How's the detective business?
I love you.
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
Sure.  I'll call the guy.
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
Why the gun?
What's going on, Tom?  What happened?
Tom...
Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?
You owe me an explanation.  You can't treat me like this.
You're killing me...
Who are you calling?
What?
What do you want?
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
I'd like to commission a work.  I'm a great admirer of yours.
A fellow investor.
That's five thousand dollars.
And they are?
Machine.
You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind?
I'd rather you didn't.
Machine's in?
Where are the women?
What are these for?
Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
Friend of yours?
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
Is that him?
You're a dead man.
Leave him alone.
... sorry...
What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?
There are reasons for the way we do things here.
Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
What?
You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...
Who is Machine?
I don't know...
Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
How much did he pay you?
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
What the fuck do you want from me?
I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.
What did you do with her body?
Keep moving.
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
Don't think I won't.
You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
Look, you cocksucker...
Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.
That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
I was well compensated.
You're making me very angry.
A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain...
Isn't it incredibly obvious?
Yeah... guess so.
Pardon me?
Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.
How long you been working there?
Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
Not quite.
How much do you make now?
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
... Hello... ?
You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.
What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.
What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
I don't know, where are yours?
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
What about me?
Specialty product.
You're learning.
Alright, I get the picture.
He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.
Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?
What's next?
Look... that's awful generous and everything...
He's odd.
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now, that is.
There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
It's a film... of a girl being murdered.
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents...
Okay, I follow you so far...
Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
You're joking.
For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
Okay.
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
How are you?  Having any luck?
I don't understand, who are... ?
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
Yes, but...
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
No.
They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.
She just seemed... depressed... ?
Yes.
Why do you think he did it?
I had to ask.  I apologize.
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
Hello... ?
She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
Who are you?
No...
He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
What is this?
Those are her belongings.
Her belongings?
None too discreet, is he?
No, sir, he is not.
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
Okay, I'll take it all.
I'm required by state law to inform you that, while it's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items, it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of...
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
What?
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
Rick...I can't.
Kincaid and Joey died last night.
You alright?
We'll figure it out.
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
Sounds like a game show host to me.
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
Kristen, what happened?
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
We have matching luggage.
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...
Extra money, huh?
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
How long have you been awake?
Rick, please.
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
I don't get it.
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
Honey, we went over this in therapy.
It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
You just stay put.  You need rest.
Excuse us, dear.
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
How did you know that?
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
Is that who you're waiting for?
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.
Who says I don't like you?
But how...?
Hi, beautiful.
Jesus!  Don't do that!
The tickets.
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
Dad!
How was the meeting?
Alice...
I've got to go.
Did everyone call everyone?
Oh, Alice...no.  Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...
I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
He sure loves to stay awake.
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
Mark, are you okay?
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
They think I'm nuts.
They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
Next life.  Oh, what's that?
He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.
Bottom line, Alice.  Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.
Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!
You, too?
How is he - ?
It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
What is it?
Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
My father!  He's not - ?
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
You 'trade school boys' are all alike, aren't you?  Anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is, ipso facto, a coward!
Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>!  It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...
That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder -
Yes?
I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -
But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
So?
But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.
'Us?'
How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up.
I don't hear anything.  Maybe you've been down here too long.  Why don't you go back up and -
Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!
Somewhere down there?
Get ready.  We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.
Is there any way out of it?
What about down?
Course and speed?
You better take Powell and Carney with you --
Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
...above Murmansk, and Finland.
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?
....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it....  ...'recharging his batteries'?
Huh?
What's the running time?
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
That's a <u>face</u>???
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
Well, I'll be - !
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
Who?
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
Chub says you're fired.
I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like me. I just want to be a good father.
I plan to. Soon.
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
You heard the news.
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
He's on to us!
Shit! What are we gonna do?
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
If you get it?
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
I used to play ball.
Yeah?
Double A. New Britain.
Really.
Hmm.
Safety on?
This way.
Fresh tracks.  Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.
You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems. 
Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
Bastard's got his high beams on.
Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack, I got to get back, get back to town. Move this thing, will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there, okay?
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
On your sleeve.
Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
Saw him do it?
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
Open the door. We're late.
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
Break stuff?
Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
I just think you used to be bad.
I don't want to.
What then?
It's stupid.
It's fun.
No what?
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
Yes.
Jesus, why?
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.
Yes.
Yes.
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
Yes.
It belongs to Pop.
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
Nothing.
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's.
Okay.
Please don't cry. Please, honey.
What are you sorry for?
I want to go home.
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
Huh?
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens.
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
Something bugging you?
Yeah. A few things.
What do I have to do for it?
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
Want to buy?
I won't. You interested?
Maybe.
You and Mel Gordon?
The key, Wade.
While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname?
Yeah.
It's just...
Yeah, lots.
See. Get your boots.
I know who it is.
Mel Gordon.
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.
See you tomorrow, maybe.
You okay?
Yeah.
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
Forget it.
Call me.
Tonight. Let's get together.
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
Oh, Wade.
Did you tell them?  That we were coming?
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
I know your parents.
Think they're alright?
Of course! I would've heard.
This is nuts.
There's a furnace.
You're not using it today?
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
When did she die?
It makes me sad.
Can --?
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
He's asleep. We were up very late.
Something about my father?
It don't look right.
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
This town sucks.
That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
Where... how'd you hear that?
Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.
Rolfe.
You remember Margie Fogg?
Yeah.
In the living room.
Pop, for Christ's sake!
You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!
Love! I'm made of love!
Who?
Well, it was an accident.
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
The night before the shooting.
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
Who?
Yeah, I guess.
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.
Find them everywhere. 
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
That it wasn't an accident.
Then who shot him?
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
Money.
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another.
It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.
I'm sure he's busy.
Alice...
I'm sorry, honey.
Your father never means to be so...
Some kids were teasing you?
You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.
Daddy. Daddy, please...
You're one of Stravanavitch's men.
Did we warn them off?
It's cut.
Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.
Put your pilot on.
Who's flying the fucking plane?
Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.
Got it.
How we doing, Colonel?
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
He's dead then. They must have killed him.
Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be.  Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
But they start executing hostages in
They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means?
If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?
Because it is my duty.
Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
That's affirmative.
Dead.
Nine.
Who did this?
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
Tower, here.
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.  We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations.  We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.
Here's a press kit.  I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.
*                     Please tell me your name.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
What do you want with us?
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
No.
Four...
Jim...
Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.
She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
May I speak to you for a moment?
She's a big girl.  She understands.
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.
I don't know why you stayed.
What are you doing?
The fax machines.
Someone should give you a raise.
This is the President.
Yeah, right.
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
You wanna knock of f?
With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.
Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.
I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please.
Shepherd.
And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let <u>me</u> talk to them.
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
Forget it.  I was reading.
I was reading too.
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
Did you feel that?
Felt like a large asteroid.
Oveur.
There's nothing wrong with me!
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
Ted!  What are you...?
Elaine.
We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
What word would you use, Elaine?
I'd use the word insane.
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
Elaine!
Elaine, what's going on?
Not now, Elaine.
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.
You mean...
That's right -- premature ejection.
What will happen to him, Ted?
We've blown the computer!  Elaine!  Set course change!
So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
Simon.
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
Simon, what's happening?!
Maybe.
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.
I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
Roger.
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
Go ahead.
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
Can I hold him?
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
What should I say?
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
Whenever your're ready, Captain.
Yes.
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
I have to see Bud Kruger.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
Don't try to stop me!
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
Excuse me, are you alright?  I noticed you talking to yourself.  I'm a nurse.  Can I be of some help?
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
No. I'm all alone.
Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.
Both pilots!
Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.
Surely there must be something you can do.
George Zipp said that?
And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."
Captain, how soon can we land?
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
That's right.
No.
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
Ted!
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
But if you'll just give me...
Ted, what are you doing here?
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
I love you, Elaine.
Headquarters!? What is it?
I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
Rats! I've lost number three.
We'd better get back now.
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.
You promise you'll write.
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?
Yes, Captain?
Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.
He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.
You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!
I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.
I'm Randy.
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
Oh, I'd love to.
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.
Do you feel all right, sir?
Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
I like my horizons narrow.
So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?
I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
When we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley.
Here?
Let's talk Hubley.
There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?
What's this?  What's going on?
Get the picture?
And that fits?
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.
Did you talk to him?
Back off, George.
But I-- .
Matthew, you don't have to-- .
You know that guy?
From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.
I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?
Yeah... I know the routine.
Human children can be very beautiful.  Getting married?  Congratulations. You will be taking Sunday off, then...
In the other man's rectum.
Your health...
I'm going home.
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
To the... to the beach?
Stop the car.
Why?
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's not nothing now.  Don't lie to me, George, you're bad at it.
Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
We?  You've taken it?
They had months in quarantine to develop the plan.  Porter, with his chemistry background, must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug.  Hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery.  Strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution network.  And Harcourt--
Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.
George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...
We can't let him get away.
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
Only holds five.
You think this is the guy who did it?
Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.
Yeah, I heard of it.
Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--
No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.
Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
Yeah, Sykes?
Departmental policy.
Hope their plumbing's the same.
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
You got your vest?
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
I can't!  Do you mind!
Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?
Movement!
How long until it blows?
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.
You did okay, Bishop.
Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
I get the picture.
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
That's right.
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?
I hope you're right.  I really do.
They're right under the primary heat exchangers.
No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.
Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?
Where are your parents?  You have to try...
I don't know.
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!
I told them to fall back...
At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
Are there any questions?  Hudson?
All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...
Alive?
Well you're not reading it right!
Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk, John L.   Died during procedure.  They killed him getting it off.
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
They're in the approach corridor.
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
It's game time.
Locked.
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest?
You're just reading me.
Sounds like you, Hicks.
Thanks.
We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
Think of what?  We're fucked.
Range twenty meters.
Fifteen meters.
Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big fucking signal.  Ten meters.
Nine meters.  Eight.
Yeah.  What?
Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'
So what do I tell this guy?
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
Casey.  She's my only friend.
I'm sorry, Newt.
Yes, there are, aren't there.
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.
I don't know, Newt.  That's the truth.
Newt.  Newt, wake up.
Wah...?  Where are...?
Burke!  Open the door!
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
This way.  Come on, we're almost there!
That's right.
The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...
Why won't you check out LV-426?
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word.
Maestro.
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
Where?
A brothel.
Oh!
Did you know? Had you heard?
What?
The marriage!
Well, what does it matter to you?
Don't bother!
No, she's fine.
Hardly.
Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
You have leave to try.
If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me.
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
In the pot, I have got a good dinner. Not a sausage or stew, but a singer. Not a sausage or stew but a singer. Is the treat that I'll eat for my meat!
Yes!
Stop it!
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
Where?
Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.
Why not?
Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
Why? People fart backwards.
Yes, you are. You're very sick.
Em iram! Em iram!
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
No!
Ui-vol-i-tub!
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
Yes!
Well, don't do that again!
How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
Don't be stupid.
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
Yes!
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?
Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
Why not? Half the house!
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
Why not?
That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
How charming.  But why did he not come himself?
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
Really?
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
I see.
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.
These are originals?
It is miraculous.
Alone.
What for?
Some service deserves service in return. No?
What do you mean?
I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?
Why you?
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
He asked me to stay.
Not at all.
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?
You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
When, may I ask?
But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.
Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
Gertrude!
I said play!
Really?
What a charming idea. May I see?
It's just a trifle, of course.
May I try it?
Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
You do me too much honour, Sire.
A-flat, Majesty.
And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
Yes?
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
Why not?
Really?
Do you like this, Salieri?
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
Why so?
Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.
Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head.
Yes, indeed.
Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!
Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
What do you mean, Sire?
My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.
Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?
What is it?
Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?
Yes, Sire.
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
Ah, love again.
I have no idea.
Yes, sir.
Well, what do you have for me today?
I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.
Why are you here?
Am I not welcome?
She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
Don't you have a maid?
How many pupils do you have?
Yes.
What's that?
No, really!
Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
Why? What has happened?
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
What medicine?
Where?
Is he working?
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
Yes?
Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?
Well?
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
Wolfi!
What is this?
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
Why not?
