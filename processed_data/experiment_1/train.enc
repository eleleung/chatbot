You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
Cameron.
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
Why?
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
That's because it's such a nice one.
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
You got something on your mind?
You have my word.  As a gentleman
How do you get your hair to look like that?
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
She's not a...
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
You know Chastity?
I was?
But
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
do you listen to this crap?
What crap?
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
No
Wow
She okay?
They do to!
Did you change your hair?
No.
Where did he go?  He was just here.
Who?
Great
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
Neat...
Hi, Joey.
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
What do you think?
What's normal?
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
You are so completely unbalanced.
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
Why?
But you hate Joey
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
You did what?
But
Why didn't you tell me?
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
That's not
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
Let go!
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
Patrick -- is that- a.
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
What if she never starts dating?
But she doesn't want to date.
Daddy, I --
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Otherwise known as an orgy?
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
Wear the belly before you go.
Why?
The prom?  Kat has a date?
No, but
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
I'm missing something.
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
Never
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
So they tell me...
So -- which Dakota you from?
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
How many people were in your old school?
Thirty-two.
How many people go here?
That I'm used to.
You burn, you pine, you perish?
Who is she?
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Why not?
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
He always have that shit-eating grin?
You know French?
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
What about him?
What makes you think he'll do it?
He seems like he thrives on danger
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
It's a lung cancer issue
Her favorite uncle
He's pretty!
Assail your ears for one night.
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
What've you got for me?
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
What 're you talking about?
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
Sure
What'd you do to her?
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
You makin' any headway?
She kissed me.
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
Hey -- do you mind?
Where ya goin?
Away.
Leave my sister alone.
Two legs, nice rack...
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
You just said
You need money to take a girl out
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
I'm on it
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
What?
A hundred bucks a date.
It's about time.
Do what?
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
Hey.
Are you lost?
Nope - just came by to chat
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
Does this conversation have a purpose?
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
You and Verona?
Who's that?
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
William would never have gone to a state school.
William didn't even go to high school
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?
Does it matter?
You think this'll work?
What'd he say?
I didn't have a choice.
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Have you seen him?
Who?
William - he asked me to meet him here.
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
And why would I do that?
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
Are you following me?
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
You're not a big talker, are you?
hey.  Great show, huh?
Excuse me?
That's what you want, isn't it?
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.
You know who The Raincoats are?
What's this?
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
I say, do what you wanna do.
I just need to lie down for awhile
I know, just let me sleep
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
I told you
Sure, I do
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Like you could find one
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Why'd you let him get to you?
Who?
Dorsey.
I hate him.
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
I thought you were above all that
And I'm in control of it.
When you were gone last year -- where were you?
Maybe.
I should do this.
My father wouldn't approve of that that
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
Who?
BIANCA
You 're so --
Wholesome.
So what did I have an effect on ?
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
Put your right foot there --
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
The Partridge Family?
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
Good call.
A soft side? Who knew?
So what's your excuse?
Acting the way we do.
Yes
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
Something like that
Then you screwed up
You up for it?
State trooper?
Fallacy.
The duck?
Hearsay.
Tell me something true.
I hate peas.
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
What?
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
You know what I mean
No.
No, I won't go with you
Why not?
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
You tell me.
You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
Answer the question, Patrick
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
It's just something I had.  You know
Oh huh
My grandmother's .
That ' s completely adorable!
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
It wasn't like that.
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
Is that right?
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
Because I like to torture you.
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
My insurance does not cover PMS
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
I thought you were punishing me.
Why can't we agree on this?
Because you're making decisions for me.
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
Was that your sister?
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?
No, Daddy.
Parts of it.
Which parts?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Bianca did what?
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.
When I go?
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
Tempestuous?
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
Hi.
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
You think?
Right.
Kat a fan, too?
Say it
What?
What plan?
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
That's where we can help you.  With Kat.
So Dorsey can get the girl?
What?!
Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
So you got cozy with she who stings?
You were right. She's still pissed.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
I missed you.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
Touch of the flu.
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
What's to discuss?
You're completely demented.
In the microwave.
What's a synonym for throbbing?
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
Tumescent!
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
Have a great time, honey!
What just happened?
Your daughters went to the prom.
Did I have anything to say about it?
Absolutely not.
I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
He's the devil's child...
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
I am, Your Eminence
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
Your life, and that of others!
Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
The Judgment is ours!
He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
I know.
I haven't given you much of a life.
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
Are we going to argue?
She said yes.
I don't want you to wait for me.
You don't usually ask.
God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
They took everything...
Can't you stay with us a little?
What is it, now?  Tell me...
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
My letters of appointment.
Appointment to what?
Viceroy of the West Indies.
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
I want to go with you!
There'll be a time.
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
I have to explore the mainland.
How are you feeling, Fernando?
What does he say?
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
No...
No?
I'm not bargaining!
And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...
You defend yourself admirably...
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
All I have to do is call the guards.
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
You come!  You speak first!
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Chief knows.
Chief says -- how many?
Thousands.
To bring the word of God.
Chief says -- he has a God.
... and also to bring medicine.
Chief says...
Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...
God... That's in a week!
That's what it says.
Why do you wish to sail west?
How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
Esdras is a Jew.
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
Father Marchena!
Passion is something one cannot control!
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
Colon!
All of them!  Just lies!
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
What are you saying?
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
How long?
May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!
If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
I suppose we're both old men now.
I have to disagree.
I knew you would.
New worlds create new people.
Oh?  So you are a new man?
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
The ocean is uncrossable?
What did they say about Granada before today?
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
How old are you, Senor Colon?
Do they have such thoughts?
Thank you.
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.
You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?
We don't need to know.
We can't raise the wheel without it.
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...
And what do you think Mendez?
What do you read?
What's he doing?
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
Where can I meet this man?
You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
We're lost!
The land is there.  I know it!
You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
... Into a monk...
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.
He must be replaced.
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.
Oh no!  No!  Shit!
Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
Don't say anything.
Where are we going?
I'm coming with you.
Yes.  Yes, come with me!
I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.
...delusions and paranoia.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
No, he is here.  Shit...
No.  No way.
But it's...
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
Your mother was blind?
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Back in the Czech Republic?
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
I can't take you to my place.
You considered becoming a prostitute?
Did you ever turn tricks before?
No.
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
So you were never a prostitute?
What are you asking me?
I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
Are you alright?
Is he your boyfriend?
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
You better get packed.
Do you have coffee?
In the kitchen.
I'll make some for us.
What are you doing?
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
I don't want to drag you down with me.
C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
A cop?
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
Oh.
It was my decision, not his.
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
Oh yeah...?  Alright.
Who did cause and origin?
Who do you think, Chief?!
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
Chief - mind if I take her?
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
End my career?
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
But Chief?  Over this??
Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.
What was that, Korfin?
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid kid.
What's he looking for?
Takin' a bath.
Any I.D.?
Sorry...PD only.
Only one guys checked in?
The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
Who's there?
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
What's wrong?
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
No.
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
Describe him.
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.
You know what that is, right?
It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.
Watch the news?
Nah, I musta missed it.
Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
Nah, why should you?
Did you get a report from the M.E.?
Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
Pretty.
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
What would you call her?
Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
This isn't homicide school.
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
You're Polish?
You goin' to the escort service?
You got any better ideas?
Mind if I ride along with you?
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
Two heads.
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.
You thirsty?
So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
Of course.
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
Why not?
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
You wanna talk to her alone?
Yeah.
What would your girlfriend think of that?
I don't have a girlfriend.
I'm serious here.
So am I.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.
Hey.  I'm a professional.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?
So...who's Nicky?
What's your accomplishment.
I kill someone famous.
Then do it, asshole.
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
Detective, does it look like a murder?
We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
How many victims are up there?
There are two bodies found at this point.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
Is it drug related?
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Eddie, are you okay?
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
Alright.
Alright.
Alright.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
Stop it.
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
I'm not.
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
You're ruthless.
Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?
Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.
No.  Tell me what you want to say.
Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight!
That's good.
Yeah.
Well, that's great.
Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.
No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.
I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
Okay, til tonight.
Tonight.
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
Okay.
Thank you.
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
Sooner or later that's everybody.
Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
So what's unique?
That's unique.
I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me.
Any chance we can do that again?
I am butcher.
You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?
You stuff sausage in it.
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
What?  It doesn't work that way.
C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh, look, you're sweating.  You don't have the balls.
Where's your partner?
Let her go!  Let her go!!
Hi, I'm Honey.
Where's Czech girl?
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
Give me the address!!
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
Two weeks holiday.
How much money are you carrying with you?
I have five-hundred dollars.
Is he with you?  Are you travelling together?
Please join us.  Come on forward.
How long are you planning to stay?
Two weeks.
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
This all you want?
In here, says he wants a million.
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
Don't speak Russian!
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.
Turn that off!  Get the bags.
Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.
What?
Turn that fucking thing off!
Speak English!
You said speak Czech!
How you erase this?
Whore?
Get in the bathroom!
Shut up.
Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!
What is it?
I did.
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
Why not?
No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous!
You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.
Credit?
Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
You got that?
Emil???!
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
Did you hurt her?
Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!
I can get you a job.
Yes, the money is good.
As a plumber?!
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
We started over, you can too.
Robert...?
What are you doing here?
You've got a call.
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
Viewer discretion advised!
Isn't he a little moody?
Yeah?
If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
I know.
I want to hear everything he said.
I'm trying to tell you.
Yes...he's my friend.
I speak English.
New York.
Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
A cheap hotel.
What are you coming here to do?
Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
No.  Go ahead.
So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?
That's what it looks like to me.
I'll take him.
He's my collar!
Well, he killed my partner!
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
I'll send a cop back for you.
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
How did you start the fire this time?
I used an accelerant.
Yeah?  What kind?
Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Mouth's clean, too.
Clean?
The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run.
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.
He knew all along.
What??
What?
Yeah?
-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is.
You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.
Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!
It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
How was it?
Get outta here!
What the hell happened?
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
What are you gonna do?
Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.
Your doctor?
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?

Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
Right. Just a sec.
Okay. 
Sure, what is it?
It's about my salary cheques.
Yes?
That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.
Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
Really.
Yes.
It's possible.
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
How?
Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.
Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
But not completely inconceivable?
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
I guess it isn't.
Well, that's something.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
Good morning. How's it going?
Are you reasonably awake?
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
Two more.
Hal?
It's the last one.
I guess not.
I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.
What is it, Hal?
The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.
Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.
Sure, Dave, what's up?
Yes, I know.
You probably also know that we found them okay.
I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.
Well, don't worry about it.
And don't you worry about it.
Too bad about Frank, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
The antenna has to be replaced.
If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.
Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
I am prepared to do that anyway.

CONINUED
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
I'm having a party tomorrow.
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
Are you coming to my party?
No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
When are you coming home?
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
Where is Mrs. Brown?
She's in the bathroom.
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
Thank you, Daddy.
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Oh, thank you very much.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
How is gregor?
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
How do you do, Mr. Miller?
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Yes, I think so. Just about then.
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.
Are you quite sure?
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
Really?
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Fortunately, they did.
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
Any ideas about the colour?
Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
What do you mean?
Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
I see.
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.
I will if I can, Frank.
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
That's true.
That's true
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
That's true.
Hal, have pod arms secure the component.
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
I understand.
Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
Roger.
Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.
Yes, Hal, what's up?
We don't wash 'em, ya know.
How about chargin' the battery?
Yeah.
Vodka.
Now how's your memory doin'?
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
I don't give a damn about his girl...
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
I want to drive awhile.
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
Whaddya mean, buy?
Pay money?
Yeah, dummy.  Money.
I never paid for it in my life.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
Hey, what about me?
I'm candy...
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
Hey, what kind of talk is that?
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
You're in a hurry.
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
What's the matter with my place?
Hello, again.
Here you go, baby.
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
How about it?
I hear you've got visitors.
Would you guys...
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
You're gonna help us take him.
Where's ganz?
You lying son of a bitch...
I don't think you're gonna make it.
I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.
You got a name, cop?
You here to write my life story?
Yeah, I noticed...
Yeah?
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
You're crazy.
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
I got a lot to protect.
This prison gives out $400 suits?
Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.
You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
No way to start a partnership.
Yeah.
Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?
Luther was part of the gang?
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
What do you think?
I think you better put him on ice, man.
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
We eat when I say we eat.
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
Now, where we goin', convict?
Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.
Well?
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
Hey, you wanna bet?
What are you talkin' about?
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
Must be billy's girl.
You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
Yeah, right.  You want to try again?
I been waiting a long time for some money.
How much?
Half a million.
Just tell me about the money.
He's after your money.
We split 50-50?
Not likely, convict.
Where's the money?
Where's the goddamn car?
...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.
Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
What?
Musta got some primo bondsman.
Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...
A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...
You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.
No class...
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
You stay with me...
Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.
Where's luther?
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
What about Luther?
We missed.
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
Yeah, I see her.
That was quick.
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
Why?
Notice something funny about that bus?
Hey, how'd my car get here?
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.
It's late, they're closing...
Do I get to kiss her too?
What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.
Hey, there she is...
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
Partnership?
You okay?
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.
Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
Thanks.
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
I lost them, that's what happened.
How did they get away?
Which one pulled the trigger?
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
What a screw-up.
I didn't have the time.
He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.
Where the Christ do you think you're going?
That's what you say, Cates...
Yeah.
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.
Billy Bear...
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
You look awful.
So do you...been a long day.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
Doesn't look like it.
Bullshit red tape.
Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
A cop...
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
When? How?
I don't think your gun's loaded...
I'm all wet.
What'd you do?
I guess he got the message...
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.
Maybe you ought to buy me one.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.
What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
That's the way I see it, too.
Call me later.
Thanks for the coffee.
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Great place for lunch.
Yeah, one of my favorites.
Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...
Jack, are you okay?
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
No wonder you're so popular.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...
Hello.
Hey, I don't believe it.
Hiya, kid.
Don't.  We've had a hard night.
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
So what?
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Whaddya think?
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
Three more hours...
Where is he?
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
Tell me.
You're impossible...
Who the hell are you?
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
Hey, two days with him is enough.
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...
Hey...
Keep stallin'.
How hot are they?
How ya doin'?
Can't complain.
We got a lot to talk about.
Yeah, old times.
Surprise, Luther.
Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...
Don't give me this, we were partners.
Billy, go ahead, break it...
No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
Come on, you can trust me. Please.
Let her go.
How you doing, man?
You want to go outside?
You sure?
How about some ammo?
How much?
Don't mess with me. How much?
Five bills.
Five.  On credit.
Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?
Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.
Appipulai Leeloo Minai..
Corn-i-Lius?
What're you laughing about?
The case..with the stones... Where is it?
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!
Akta dedero ansila do mektet.
...We're saved!
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
Why?  What's wrong with me?
No thank you.
...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life!
Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
You are a monster, Zorg!
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
Who are you?
He's a she!
They all like this in your family, father?
She's an exception..
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
It means, "Never without my permission".
I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.
Good luck..
Of course.
You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
Leeloo's in trouble?
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
And then?
Is there anything that can stop it?
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
Father, will you please explain what's going on?
Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
Where's Leeloo?
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...
Leeloo... is... she's...
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
Do you love her?
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
I don't have time... I need to know.
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
Yeah?
I was talking to the cat.
At least, the cat comes back.
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.
I just found a picture of you.
How do I look?
I don't need one.
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
How many points you got left on your license?
Hello?
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
So, just how big was this fare?
Akina delutan, nou-shan.
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!
...Priest...
Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...
Eto Akta Gamat!
...What's your name?
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
The Fifth Element...
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
When EVIL returns so shall we.
Hi Ma...
Are you listening to me, you ingrate!
Other than that... You all right?
I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
Hello?
You little sleaze bag!
...Ma???
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
You have nine points left on your license..
I'm sorry..
...Hi.
...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?
I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal?
I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
I don't think this is a good time...
...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?
He's on vacation.
Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
I don't even know what I'm looking for!
Solid little jobs, aren't they?
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
Is that all?
Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
What mission?
To save the world.
You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?
Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.
And the third one?
Don't you open your messages?
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
I'm not going.
Why not?
...Shit!
I thought you were divorced.
...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.
Three of us will never fit in there!
Apipoulai!
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
You hear that?
Dinoine chagantakat!
Apipoulai!
Love...
Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
Finished what?
Learning language.
Which one?
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
Apipoussan!
Apipoussan?
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
Uh...
Here we go again...
You know women normally change five times more than men.
You get that off the screen?
You noticed..
Where you going?
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
You're nothing but a... a...
I'm so very sad.
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
The wind blows... the fire burns...
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
It's up to you now, Angel!
I'm so tired...
I want to sleep... forever...
What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!
...Like love...
Exactly.
I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.
Why?... Why would you need me?
Not going to open?
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
At least I won lunch.
Been here long?
Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
Uh..
It's not?
This is all that survived?
Actually only one cell survived..
Have you identified it?
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
Talk English Doc.
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?
This thing solid?
Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.
And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage?
They just landed in the desert.
Staedert, do you read me?
Is that better?
Perfect, Mr. President.
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
Wait or act.
Recommendations.
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am going to be famous.
How's that? Can you hear me better now?
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
Am I disturbing you?
...Not far, now.
Got it.
How's our deal coming along?
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
Welcome home.
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
Your clothing reeks of it.
You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?
I'm not accusing you...
Okay, I believe you.
Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.
I understand.
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.
I know.
Hello?
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
... What's going on?
What happened to you?
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me...
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
You couldn't?
You don't understand...
No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
You should have.
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
I don't know what to say
Don't...
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
Mrs. Christian.
She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...
What are these?
Anything harder?
There's nothing harder.
Snuff?
What you see is what I got, mister.
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
What are you talking about?
The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
Bullshit.
I'm telling you...
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
Dino...
What the fuck... !
It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.
Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
You said something about money.
Is it?
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
I want to watch you work.
I'll consider it.
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
We can do that.
What's the problem?
I'm camera shy.
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars.
Where's that?
You brought the money?
Excellent.
Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?
What are you... ?
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
Look, I don't know what this...
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.
You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?
Call me Tom.
Alright, Tom.
What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
I figured you share information.
We do.
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
Why don't they come to me?
This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
I'm not so sure about this.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
Any good?
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
Celebrity Films.
Eddie.
Yeah, who's this?
I know what you did.
I know what you did.
Who is this.
What the fuck are you.. ?
What's he talking about?
I'm gonna kill you.
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
Don't ask questions.
Starting to recognize a pattern?
What do you want?
I want his name.
I told you, I don't know.
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
Yeah.
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.
Something like that.
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.
Why?
You enjoy it?
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
Tell me what happened.
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
Nobody saw you bring her in?
There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
Stop talking.
You got absolute zero.
Show me where you buried her.
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
Where?  Show me where.
Do it.
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
Easy enough for you.
I never killed anyone.
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?
Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
I'm listening.
Of what sort?
You are a private investigator?
That's right.
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
Never mind how I found you.
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
They're no friends of mine.
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...
Shut up.
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
Shut your mouth and drive!
Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
You're asking me why?
Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
Enlighten me.
You almost went over your limit.
Give me the film.
Give me the film.
He's lying.
Big date tonight?
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
Truman Capote.
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
Remember me?
I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help.
Three, four years.
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
Max.
There's not much illegal.
Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.
I'm not a cop.
You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
How much?
Four hundred a week, off the books.
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
Sounds good, pops.
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
Interesting theory.
Child pornography.
There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.
Snuff films.
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
How old are you?
Twenty-five.
Where are your parents?
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
A daughter.
So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.
A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.
Where does he sell it?
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
I'm a working stiff, pops.
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
It's their Presidential Suite.
Wha... ?
Who is he?
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
Who is he, his name?
You don't need to be here.
I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil."
I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
What's this?
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
Uh huh, pleasure.
Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places.
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now.
My condolences.
Pittsburgh?
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
He succeeded.
Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?
I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.
You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
Do you want to tell me what you found?
I'm afraid I don't...
I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can't go to the police...
Please, believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...
No.
I'm telling you it's not that.
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
You... you need to go to the police.
I told you I can't, not yet.
You don't have any other choice.
No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
It won't work like that.
I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...
You've found missing persons before.
Nothing remotely like this.
Okay...
My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
I'm not positive this means anything.
Hello... ?
I'm here.
Do you think the film could have cost that much?
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
You told me to look, so I looked.
Hello?
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
I hope it's nothing serious.
Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve.
How will I get it to you?
Yes... ?
I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.
Neil... Neil Cole.
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.
So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?
No.
She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.
What was she running from?
I don't know.
If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
It got to be too much for him.
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
I didn't mean to...
You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now?
I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...
Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.
We're all like that.
Are you religious?
No.
What?
It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
There wasn't one.  The police looked.
Do you think the police did a good job?
I don't know.  I think so.
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
How... how can you say that to me...?
Will you let me look?
My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?
I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.
It's been six years.
Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
I remember.  You just left...
What are you talking about... ?
Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.
Who is this... ?
They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
No... no... no...
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
Yes... I remember Mary
You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
Do you know what happened to her?
Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?
Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night.  The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman.  It's unpleasant, I know.  I apologize...
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first?
No, you may not.
Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
Alice, you think you can leave?
What's wrong?
I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one?
It was bad.
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's.
It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
I can't go back to sleep again.
Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you.
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
I'm sure they're around.
I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.
My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?
No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.
You what?
You in a hurry?
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
You've been up all night?
That obvious, huh?
Then you saw him, too?
No...
You're his sister, right?
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed.
No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!
I've been working double shifts.
Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?
Not really.
Is there something we can do?
You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.
Then what else can we do?
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
You just feel sorry for me.
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.
Here we are.
What the hell was that?
You look great!
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.
It was Freddy.
Enough of that crap.
T-T-Thanks Alice...
Hey, Rick!
So what's up?  What'd I miss?
She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
So?
Nice neighborhood.
Hey man, we're all sorry...
Been up with Alice.
How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
About Freddy?
Something the matter with the cuisine?
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
What's wrong with me?
I'm sorry honey, but...
Something wrong with the stairs?
Avoid-all-contact-day.
What?
What is it?
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
I'll tell you later.
It's okay, babe.  We're with you.
Feeling better now?
I gotta get out of here.
You don't get it, he's after me...
Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?
Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility.
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
Hey...wake up.
It's lonely in there, in my room.
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
She doesn't want me around
No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?
Mommy...?
Where is he?
What do you mean?
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
Okay, babe.  What's the matter?
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
About him?
You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream.
Yeah...I guess.
You're right.
There you go.  Love you.
I was afraid you weren't coming.
I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
Where are we going?
Thanks for everything, Dad.
You sure you don't want a ride to work?
I'm so sorry, honey...
Sobering...
Very funny.
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
Since my little girl became a mom...
You disappointed in me?
Alice!
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
But Dad --
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
Had kind of a long night.
Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.
It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way.
Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?
There aren't any little boys on your floor.
What's that got to do with it?
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?
You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?
I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.
Krueger is reality.
And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
Are you alright?
You think that's the place she's buried?
What?
But how are we gonna --
You do good work, Alice.
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
I've got to write some of this down.
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...
I thought about that.
Then get out!
Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?
Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.
Who's Jacob?
My baby!
Whoa, slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?
Where are you going?
I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
But I've seen her grave.
Poor woman...
I don't understand.
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!
That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.
Who?
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
These things are wild...  What do you think?
All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...
Yeah...
Have another one, sounds like you need it.
Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.
Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.
Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.
Vomit?
Mark...
I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
It's okay.
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
You could train someone else.
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
Unidentified Flying Objects.
That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !
However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.
But if they <u>do</u>?
I don't know.
Reef!
So they caught up with you, too?
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!
Huh?
I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?
I guess.
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
Cyclops?
We're stuck tight!
You've got to let us try, Skipper --
You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look.
What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!
I think you're right.
Yeah?
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
You hear that?
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
Well?
Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.
Dave - !
Seems to be all around...
A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!
What course, Skipper?
The frogmen?
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
Excuse me, Skipper---
Yes, Griff?
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
Something wrong?
Why do you say that?
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!
Wonderful!
Now they feel it...down below.
Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...
Anything ---
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
Under <u>water</u>?
<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
As we near the Pole...
There's got to be an explanation!
All ready?
Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.
I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.
Who with?
'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?
What do you think?
Determine extent of damage, immediately.
You're sure it's Cyclops?
Right <u>at</u> him?
That's what I said!
But - what can we accomplish?
A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....
It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
What?
Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
Swell!
He did!
Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?
Why?
It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
Obviously.
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.
See what?
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.
You got yourself a computer, Alma.
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
Are you alright, Wade?
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
Always has been.
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
Who?
...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
You don't believe me?
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
Has anybody offered to buy it?
This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
Twombley involved?
No.
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
What are you boys up to?
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
Yeah. I know about that.
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
Tell me.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.
How soon?
This spring.
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
Yes.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
Oh.
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
I hear Twombley got shot.
You see it?
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
You can't buy Wade off.
We bought you.
It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
Guaranteed, eh?
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
Yeah.
You might not kill it.
You think so.
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
Mmm.
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
I'm okay.
Drafted by the Red Sox.
You played for the Sox?
Oh.
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
They said.
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
What happened?
Yeah.
Sun's gettin high.
Don't mind if I do.
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
No brag. Just fact.
I thought I told you to move that truck!
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er --
How'd you get the job?
Like you and Gordon?
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
Where'd Twombley get shot?
In the chest.
No, I mean whereabouts.
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
You stayed away?
Yeah.
Where'd you get the blood?
What blood?
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
Sure you did.
What?
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work.  But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right.
Yeah.
I'm fucking out of here.
Lawford?
Open the door, will ya?
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.
Yeah.
Those are the Hoyts.
I don't care. They're out.
Why do they do that?
Do what?
You know.
Yeah. It's stupid.
I guess they're stupid.
Did you do that when you were a kid?
Was it funny?
To us it was.
But it's not funny now.
It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
I bet you did lots of bad things.
What are you talking about?
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
It's not that.
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.
No.
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
I called Mommy.
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
See, I knew you'd be mad.
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.
Dad.
Are we going in this?
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
It's pretty old.
Pop?
How about a Big Mac?
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
No.
What do you want, then?
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.
That's illegal, you know.
I know.
You're a policeman.
Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.
I want to go home.
We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!
Tomorrow, Gordon.
Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader.
Where's the plow?
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
Don't go playing policeman.
What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
You don't want the extra police pay?
I'm not saying that.
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
Fuck you.
What's the hurry?
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
Huh?
I figured you already heard.
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
You mean Twombley?
I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
What the fuck. My day's already ruined.  Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do.
How you holding up, Wade?
I'm fine, fine.
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
On what you pay me?
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
So?
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
You? Why?
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
Could be.
Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys.
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
Lillian!
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --
She's grown up some, hasn't she?
I don't want her to go, Lillian.
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
We should talk.
We've done all our talking, Wade.
Wait there. She'll be right out.  Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?
No problem. Look, I...
You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
Did you get his number?
Good. Who?
I still don't understand --
For a while.
How's she doing?
Okay. She's fine.
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
You okay?
I'm sorry about what I said.
Said what?
I'm sorry.
You don't mean that.
Yeah. I mean that.
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
Money.
Jack doesn't need money.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.
You knew me as a kid.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
What way?
Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?
Then... I guess you have to.
There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.
I've been thinking about it, that's all.
You've been married twice --
It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
Alright. I'll think about it.
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
Strange.
How?
What happened?
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
Going somewhere, Margie?
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.
Coffee's perked.
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
What the hell are you talking about?
Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
Hold on!
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
Yes. Here's your ticket.
Who are you?
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
Take care, Wade.
What?
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
Marg!
You talked to Jack?
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
Jack?
The other guy.
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
His office. You mean my old office.
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
He got his deer yet?
Just do it.
What was that?  You got something to say, say it! Say it!
Nothing.
Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?
Sleeping.
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
Where's Ma?
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
Is there something wrong with the phone?
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.
You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?
Call it what you want.
Everything you know is from me.
Yeah.
Bang!
Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!
Crawl!
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
Rolfe.
Wade?
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
There was something. It happened up your way.
Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
Twombley.
No shit.
You think Jack shot him?
Huh?
How was she?
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
What happened?
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
Get some sleep.
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
No thanks. I don't drink.
What about Margie?
What about her?
Well, do you still plan to get married?
I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
Which is?
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
I don't know. You tell me.
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
A hunting accident is perfect.
It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?
Not particularly.
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.
Yeah.
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
Well, I never heard that one.
Wade, are you alright?
I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.
To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?
Well, you aren't the President, dear.
You don't want to say hi to your father?
Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
We'll talk at home.  You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you.  For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.
He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.
When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
Mom?
Yes dear?
I don't drink coffee.
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
The woman you shot. She was my friend.
Fuck off, you stupid asshole.
He didn't leave us.
Oooooh, I'm good.
How was...  ...the ballet?
It was the experience of a lifetime.
Alice!
Daddy...
How you doing, sweetie?
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
There they are!
The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.
Do you see the maintenance panel?
Got it.
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.
You read my mind.
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
Uh, we got a problem here.
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
We don't know that.
Walter, if you have a point, make it.
They aren't answering their hails.
They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel.
I prefered the terrorists.
Sir, you threw out page two.
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.
Can we do that?
I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
Yes, Mr. President.
Why?
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane.
About goddamn time.
Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.
We've already been inspected.
The rest of the secret service?
How many others killed?
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
why did they do that?
How?
Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.
We're not going to make it.
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
Where are we now?
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
Stand by.
We copy. Stand by...  Tower?
Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.
This is a remarkable aircraft.
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
A dubious distinction, no?
And all these rooms here?
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
You're pointing a gun at me.
Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die.
Now, or he dies, please.
Leave my daughter alone.
What do you know of my husband?
I know he left you behind.
My husband is a very courageous man.
Do you have to be so brutal?
Yes
Why? Do you enjoy it?
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.
That was war.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
Over my dead body.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
Stop.
You'll do it?
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
Someday, you'll regret my nature.
There goes your ride.
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.
Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
Twenty minutes?
Madame Vice president. We have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks.
Finally, we can bargain.
Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.
The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.
Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?
We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back.
We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
Get `em ready.  You... come with me.
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
I'll not going without my family.
Sir, we stay with the President.
Can't it wait?
Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.
For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.
How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
You know what?
What?
I miss you. And I miss her.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
How did your speech go?
Call Petrov...  I'll be back.
Flying the plane.
Excuse me?
The fax machines.
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
Where are we sending it?
Did they say anything about my family?
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
and if that means negotiating...
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?
What's going on?
We're under attack.
Where's my family?
One.
But...
White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.
Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
who can I say is calling?
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
Thank you for calling the white House...
*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.
No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?
I might still have a few chips left.
This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
Other way around, sir.
It's bait.  Don't take it.
You give me ulcers.
Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review the Iraq situation.
Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
My god. I think that was a MiG.
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.
Shit.
How long's it been since you flew, sir?
Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.
IT'S OPEN!
WE'RE HOOKED!
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.
What?
That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.
That just doesn't make any sense.
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
What's the story?
Kruger, Sagittarius.
Yes I did...
Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
What is it, Mary?
Shut down accelerators.
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.
Dunn.
Sir?
Elaine.
Te...!
It's got to be stopped!
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
Ted, what's wrong?
Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.
Elaine.
Elaine, what happened to us?
Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.
Who's that, Ted?
His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.
If that's the way you want it.
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
Ted, we're taking off!
What are you doing, Ted?
Ted.
Not now, Elaine!
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
Elaine, we have to go back.
Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
Ted!
Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
Simon just ejected!
Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
Are you afraid?
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
Set!
Now!
Ted, the lever!
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.
I mean for Ted.
You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.
Frank's the best pilot in the program.
I'm so excited, Simon.
I guess this is a first for you.
Simon, why has he become so... so...
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
Have you got it straightened out now?
I think so.
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
Can't we change course?
My career is shot.
Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there.
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.
You can do it from up here, Captain.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
Intermitant failure in scan mode "R". Analyze.
Negative.
Negative.
That's not possible.
Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.
That's okay, ROK.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
Request; life support systems check.
Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?
Scraps.
Sure.
He's a boy dog.
Yeah.
Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.
We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...
Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.
I don't want to hear that word!
Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
All right.  Here.
Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.
I don't want to live anymore.
What?
You're sure?
No.  Poached.  Over.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
Sixteen 'C', why?
He's carrying a bomb.
No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.
Captain Oveur?
That's how dry cleaning works.  Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians.
Good to be aboard, gentlemen.
You folks need any help?
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
Do you have an appointment, sir?
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
All right, it's a matter of death.
You can't go in there!
Are you on the Mercury mission?
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Striker.
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
Then Elaine was right.
Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing.
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
You've been hurt.
I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
Do you want to talk about it.
No.  I mean your relationship.
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.
I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.
Ah, won't you sit down?
Thank you. Cream?
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
Surely you can't be serious.
I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
Can't you take a guess?
Well...not for another two hours.
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.
A hospital? What is it?
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
What was it we had for dinner tonight?
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
What did he have?
Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too.
Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
Just how serious is it, doctor?
Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?
No. No one that I know of.
Elaine!
I just don't want to go over it any more.
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
What's the matter?
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?
Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.
That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
You got a telegram from headquarters today.
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
What's his problem?
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
Rain.
And a little ice.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
But Ted, you're the only...
Ted...
Yes?
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
See them, Elaine?
We have a visitor.
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.
Airsick?
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
Good-bye, darling.
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
Good-bye, darling.
Did you decide on a runway yet?
He's right on the heading.
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
Oh, I can't stand it.
How ya doing, honey?
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
Hi!
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
Yes?
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.
Roger.
Roger.
We have clearance, Clarence.
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
Excuse me, Sister?
Yes?
Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
The cockpit? What is it?
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.
Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list.  Don't take it personally.
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
You okay?
You are Cassandra?
That's right.
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
He's not here.  Why ask me?
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
In there.
Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
You don't have squat.
Look at your dildo partner.  He's too scared to even come down to the sand.  You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron!
Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy?
Lay off, asshole.
William Harcourt?
Yes...
Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
He didn't recognize me.
Kill them both.
... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all.
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
Man, somebody really hung one on you!  I've heard some good ones for you guys... Humphrey Bogart, Harley Davidson.  I guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while, coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you. You weren't at the back of the line, were you, George?
My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.
Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right?  Whatta you care?
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off?
Look, you want to fit in here, right?  You want to learn how to get along?
Yes.
What is wrong?
Well... yes, quite possibly.
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
Nothing.
Nothing?
What is this?
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.
How the hell do you know that?
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.
So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that "possible" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.
I believe I should interview the widow alone.
Did you learn anything?
A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley.
Aw-right.  What about the other guy?
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?  Listen, we just need a minute of your time...
Why did you do it?
Why'd I do what?
Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...
Who said that?
Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?
Uh, Matthew...
Screw you.
Tell me.
Your mother mates out of season.
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
If I may make a suggestion... We have different weak spots than you do.  Next time, a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm, here, will produce the effect I think you were looking for.
I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?
Which one is that?  Raw what?
This is mole.  It's good.
And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.
Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
Who is he?
We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.
I believe he is probably lying.
You are married?
Was.  Divorced.
We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
Your home is quite disordered.  I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.
... and so, and so the doctor says, "If this is the thermometer, then where'd I leave the pen?"  You're not... you don't think that's funny?  George, work with me, I always get a laugh with that one. Look, if the doctor's got the thermometer in his hand, then where's his pen gotta be?
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.
No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
I hope you can understand how special your world is... how unique a people you humans are.  So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves.
Where'd you get this?!!
She's going to divorce me.
Well, let's roll, George.
Please, I must get out here.
It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes.
What was that about?
... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style.
No secrets, goddammit!  You don't hold back from me.  Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!
No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
How potent?
We all did.
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again.
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
Uh, George...
George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit.
The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.

Shit!
With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now.
What's this about, George?  I know that look.
No!  We must do this alone.
What is this?!
... It's Harcourt.
Harcourt is dead.
No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...
I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.
Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
But there's no more drug.
How do I look?
You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well, this is it.
What is it?
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
Mr. Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager.  The men liked him.  I'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes.
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
Who else can I ask around here?
Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.
That where Anderson worked?
Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he gets like this, I can't control him. I've seen this before.  He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could do.  I hadda go throw up.
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
Released December one.  He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April.  Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering.  He and his wife have one child, a son.
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter?
Ss'kya'ta'.
One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?
Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...
The human?
You took this gut out, too, didn't you?
Yeah.
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.  We're just about to start cutting in.  You're welcome to stick around if you want.  It's really fascinating stuff.
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
What kind of test?
Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk.
Granger and Pitts are already on it.
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
How can I go?
What?
Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--
But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
Does that look at all suspicious to you?
Watch the driver.  I'm going for a better angle on the door.
Get outta there!
This floor's freezing.
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
Position?
Can't lock up...
Talk to me, Hudson.
...that's better.  Pan it around a bit.
Okay, let's do it.
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.
First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear.
Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.
Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over.
I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon.
Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.
Yes.  That follows.
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
Could it be intelligent?
That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.
And it's too late to shut it down?
I'll go.
What?
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
HOW MUCH TIME?
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
Ripley...
She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.
Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...
Have they located my daughter yet?
Is she...?
Amy.
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
No.  There's no way!
Hear me out...
What about you?  What's your interest in this?
Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
If I go.
If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...
Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...
That the atmosphere processor?
Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's move cautiously.  First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
You son of a bitch.
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
Corporal Hicks!?
Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.  Set up for life.
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
Now, wait a second --
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
Still nothing from the colony?
Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.
What's he scanning for?
We're talking thermonuclear explosion.
Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex.
One of us?
What is it?
So.
So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
How do you feel?
All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
Sir?
Yes, Hicks?
What's the question?
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
...We're coming in.
Sir, the CPU is on-line.
Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.
We're not making that out too well.  What is it?
Save it.
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!
Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right, let's move like we got a purpose.
We got problems.
Maybe we got 'em demoralized.
The corner!  Ready?
Seventeen meters.
Let's go!  Let's go!
How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?
All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.
Now many?
Newt time then can walk right up and knock.
They'll get us.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
What's this?
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found another way in, something we missed.
No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --
Hicks, don't let him leave.
Ellen.
Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.
Fuck you.
Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us.
Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short, too!  Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock.  It ain't half fair, man!
It's inside the complex.
Looks like it stung him.
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours!  Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before...
This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.
They cut the power.
This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...
Can't be.  That's inside the room!
You remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau, out past the Ilium range, a couple days ago?
There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
And how are we today?
Terrible.
How long have I been on Gateway station?
What did you say?
I don't want you for a friend.
Why not?
They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.
They're dead.
Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
You promise?
Cross my heart.
I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.
The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
I guess we're not leaving, right?
Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
No, it's different, honey.
Did you ever have a baby?
Yes.  A little girl.
Where is she?
Gone.
Don't go!  Please.
Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared.
Come on.  Crawl faster.
I knew you'd come.
Mommy...Mommy?
Are we going to sleep now?
Can we dream?
Look, I told you...
Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...
Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.
How many colonists?
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. Be my most tasty little dish! Be my most tasty little dish!

Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
Indeed.
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
His Grace is very angry with you.
Good morning.
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
Yes.
Is there a part for me?
No.
How do you know?
Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
Why not?
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
In a harem.
What's that?
A Turkish brothel.
Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway.
What does he look like?
You might be disappointed.
Why?
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
How was I? Tell me honestly.
You were sublime.
What did you think of the music?
Extremely clever.
Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write another aria for you. Something even more amazing for the second act. I have to get some water. Her mother is lying on the stage.
What?
Don't bother.
Oh - excuse me!
Is her mother still lying on the floor?
Is she a good fuck?
What??
No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
No! I won't have him back.
But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
Sir -
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
And how will you make him keep it?
Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
Why what, sir?
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
Humiliated?
Don Giovannnnnnnni!
I've come to dinnnnnner!
What is it?
I want to go!
Where?
I want to go back to Vienna.
Now?
Why?
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
No! No! No!
We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
That's stupid.
Do you think that's funny?
Oh, ha, ha, ha.
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
No, I'm not playing this game.
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
Tish-I'm tee. What's that?
What?
Tish-I'm-tee.
Eat
Yes.
Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now?
I think you're mad! You're really mad!
Oh, leave me alone.
They'll come anyway. They love me here.
No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
Oh yes? You always know everything.
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
You borrowed money from your mother?
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
Stop it now. Stop it. I've brought some friends to meet you. They're next door waiting. Do we have anything to eat? They're all starving.
Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.
What's the matter with you?
Tell them to go!
No!
My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?
Wolfi!
What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
There's a young girl to see you.
What does she want?
I don't know.
Well, ask her!
Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -
Stanzi!
We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder?  This is! a very nice girl.
Wolfi.
Yes, my love?
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
What?
Half the receipts! Stanzi!
You're not going to do this?
Oh, Stanzi.
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
Who was that?
No one.
What's that? Oh!  Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?
I'm not telling you.
Why not?
No. Don't answer it!
This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I?
Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
Give me one reason I can understand.
I can't write it!
Go back to bed.
Excellency!
Frau Mozart?
He's terribly busy, sir.
I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
Then he didn't send you?
No, sir. This is my own idea.
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
Originals?
Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his.
Come back tonight.
Tonight?
It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.
But! I'm a married woman!
What?
What are you doing here?
Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
I was at hand.
He needs me, ma'am.
This is not his handwriting.
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri. Respect my wish and go.
How much will you pay him?
Am I interrupting something?
Where's our friend?
Leave him alone!
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
He's doing his best.
I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
Money! Money!
You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
I see that you're expecting.
Oh, yes.
What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
Be careful!
He's adorable!
Behold!
Hey!
Behold!
I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.
Upstairs.
I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man.
Gertrude!
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
What a strange young man.
Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
Just one year.
Who was your teacher?
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.
My pleasure.
Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.
Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
And the result satisfies.
Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
Sire.
I don't think you understand me, Court Composer.
Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.
Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
Of course not.
I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
Yes?
Your Majesty!
Oh, thank you.
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
Majesty!
Yes, where?
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
What? On one hearing only?
It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
And German?
So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.
Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.
Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?
Excuse me, but how old are you?
Twenty-six.
Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.
May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.
Who told you this, Majesty?
Well, yes, I admit it is.
Would you tell me why?
Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here.
Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.
But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?
I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
Yes, what about him?
He's here.
Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see.
Is she not here?
Do you always live like this?
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
How is your financial situation?
It couldn't be better.
That's not what I hear.
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
They say you're in debt.
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
Pupils?
Yes.
How many?
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
Oh, let's not talk about it.
Why not?
It's a secret.
You don't have secrets from me.
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.
Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
Papa, is this your idea?
Are you playing a trick on me?
Papa!
No one calls you that.
Father -
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.
Good morning, sir.
Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.
Yes, thank you, sir.
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Do any pupils come to the house?
Not that I've seen.
Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
Really? What is it he's writing?
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
I think I've found out about the money, sir.
Where does he work?
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
I don't know. He has pains.
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
Is he working?
I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
Opera? Opera!
Are you Herr Mozart?
That's right.
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
What?
Sssh!
Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
What did he say? What did he say?
Sublime! Utterly sublime!
Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?
Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them.
I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
Animals?
I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.
German!
Leave that alone!
Put it down!
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
What?
Yes.
Can I see it?
No.
Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.
Well, we can.
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.
And which one of them do you want me to teach?
You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
Madame.
I'm afraid I am.
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?
It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!
Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?
What for?
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
