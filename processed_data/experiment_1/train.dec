Forget it.
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
That's a shame.
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
Forget French.
Well, there's someone I think might be --
I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
You're sweet.
Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
I believe we share an art instructor
You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
You always been this selfish?
No...
What crap?
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
What good stuff?
Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
Let's go.
I hope so.
They do not!
No.
You might wanna think about it
Who?
Joey.
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
Is he oily or dry?
I don't have to be home 'til two.
I did.
Hopefully.
Queen Harry?
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
Can we go now?
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
You're welcome.
Like you care.
What?
He was, like, a total babe
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
As in...
You did what?
Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
I guess I'll never know, will I?
So did you
You set me up.
No! I just wanted
Perm?
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
Exactly my point
And where're you going?
Otherwise known as an orgy?
It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going --
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
Daddy, no!
Because she'll scare them away.
No, but
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
Never
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
Just sent 'em through.
C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
How many people were in your old school?
Thirty-two.
Get out!
Couple thousand. Most of them evil
Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
Who is she?
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Why not?
I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
He always have that shit-eating grin?
Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
You could consecrate with her, my friend.
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
You wanna go out with him?
He seems like he thrives on danger
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
I thought you hated those people.
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
Will Bogey get bent?
Her favorite uncle
Dead at forty-one.
Okay!  I wasn't sure
It's her favorite band.
No, I ' m not.
I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
Don't make me do it, man
She's partial to Joey, not me
Sure
Then, go get her
I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
She kissed me.
Where?
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
They're running the rest of me next month.
Not at all
Away.
Your sister here?
And why would I do that?
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
You just said
You need money to take a girl out
But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
Fine, thirty.
Fifty, and you've got your man.
I'm on it
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
A hundred bucks a date.
Forget it.
A deal's a deal.
Get her to act like a human
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
Are you lost?
Nope - just came by to chat
We don't chat.
We're not.
So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her.  Someone who's up for the job.
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
You and Verona?
What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
He always look so
Just a little.
But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
William would never have gone to a state school.
William didn't even go to high school
That's never been proven
Does it matter?
If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any school you want, precious.  Don't forget your tiara."
No fear.
Who cares?
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
You didn't
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Who?
William - he asked me to meet him here.
Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
My mission in life.
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
I know a lot more than that
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
You -- covered in my vomit.
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
Hi
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.

That's what you want, isn't it?
Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.
You know who The Raincoats are?
Why, don't you?
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
I say, do what you wanna do.
Funny, you're the only one
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference...
Why 're you doing this?
You don't care if I die
Why?
Like you could find one
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Just let me sit down.
Who?
Dorsey.
I hate him.
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
I thought you were above all that
You know what they say
But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
Busy
No, you weren't
Do what?
You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
Who?
BIANCA
No offense, but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
Pleasant?
Unwelcome.
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
Look up, sunshine
C'mon.  It's not that bad
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
Maybe.
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
Good call.
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
Acting the way we do.
Yes
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
Something like that
Then you screwed up
How?
For. . . ?
Fallacy.
The duck?
Hearsay.
I know the porn career's a lie.
I hate peas.
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
What?
No one else knows
Go to the prom with me
No.
No what?
Why not?
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
Answer the question, Patrick
Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
It's just something I had.  You know
Oh huh
Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
What?
It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
It wasn't like that.
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
I didn't care about the money.
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
Is that right?
Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
Because I like to torture you.
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
Don ' t you even dare. . .
You decided.
Enough!
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
I thought you were punishing me.
Why can't we agree on this?
Because you're making decisions for me.
As a parent, that's my right
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
No, Daddy.
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Which parts?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Bianca did what?
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
No -- impressed.
When I go?
Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a check.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...
No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
Hi.
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
Yeah.  I guess.
Oh yeah.
Kat a fan, too?
Yeah...
What?
Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
So Dorsey can get the girl?
Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.
Good enough.
Just for now.
I'm likin' you guys better
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. People can hear you.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
With the teeth of your zipper?
I'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
What's to discuss?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
See you next week!
Make anyone cry today?
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
Tumescent!
You're not helping.
Pirate -- no question.
Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
Dr. Ruth?
But -- who -- what --?
Your daughters went to the prom.
Did I have anything to say about it?
Absolutely not.
That ' s what I thought
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
We'll all go crazy...
Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here.  Smells like a cunt. Bad sign...
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
I am, Your Eminence
Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately...  22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.
Excellency, you are right.
Your life, and that of others!
If they agree to follow me, yes.
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
The Judgment is ours!
Naturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
I haven't given you much of a life.
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
Are we going to argue?
I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
Thank God...
That's something you can't decide.
I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
They tried... but I didn't let them.
Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
I am busy inside.
I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
Yes... I remember...
Appointment to what?
Viceroy of the West Indies.
Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
I am afraid this is not the worst news.
There'll be a time.
You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
This time with me!
Not bad.
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
He never had one... except aboard my ships!
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
No?
NO...!  I have waited too long, fought too hard.  Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit!  No... I will not be your servant!
Then you are too ambitious.
If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
... for a commoner?
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
What...?  Do I have so many already?
Call them.
Island.  Far.
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Chief knows.
Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
Thousands.
Why?
Chief says -- he has a God.
... and also to bring medicine.
Chief says...
He has medicine.  Tell him we admire his people.
You never learned how to speak my language.
Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
That's what it says.
How did you manage it?
To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
Esdras is a Jew.
So was Christ!
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
Father Marchena!
Passion is something one cannot control!
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
Colon!  Don't!
What are you saying?
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
How long?
I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
You are bound by an oath, Father.
You'll always be older than me, Father.
I knew you would.
New worlds create new people.
Oh?  So you are a new man?
I don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much.  I still can't accept the world as it is!
No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
What did they say about Granada before today?
That she was impregnable.
Surely you can do anything you want.
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
A woman?
Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
We don't need to know.
We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our grief.  And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
My horse doesn't work.
You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
You will regret this.
God be with us admiral.
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
Twenty eight.
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
We can't be.
Immediately.
Six days ago, yes.
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
You think I don't know that?
The land is there.  I know it!
You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
You tell that to them!
Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.
And who would you think of, for such a task?
Then why?
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
He has the camera!  He took the movie!
Where are we going?
I'm coming with you.
Yes.  Yes, come with me!
I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him.
You bring the cigarettes?
I was all of these.
What about Oleg?
No, he is here.  Shit...
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
But it's...
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
What else do you need?
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
Your mother was blind?
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Back in the Czech Republic?
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
Can I see your back?
Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
I will if they don't send me back.
Somewhere else?
Yes, I considered it.
No.
What about back home?
So you were never a prostitute?
What are you asking me?
I'm just trying to find out who you are.
I know.
They're not gonna send you right back.
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
I'm glad I met you.
Right.
In the kitchen.
I'll make some for us.
I'll get my clothes.
Pouring it out!
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
Daphne, I...
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
Go on.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?
No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
It was my decision, not his.
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
Oh yeah...?  Alright.
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
Who do you think, Chief?!
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
I let her take a shower.
No!  Nothing happened.
Okay.  But not water sports.
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
End my career?
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
But Chief?  Over this??
There's nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.  You're suspended until your trial.
Yeah, right.
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
You do that, wiseguy.  Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does.
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
Yeah.
What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.
A timer.
Any I.D.?
Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
It's okay.
Yeah.
Stay with her.
I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
No.
Did you tell him you did?
What are you saying?
Describe him.
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.
No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
No, what is it?
Watch the news?
Nah, I musta missed it.
Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
I don't even watch TV.
Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.
Pretty.
Hmmmm.
Who says she's a suspect?
Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?
Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years.  These are very intense people and they take things personally.
I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
This isn't homicide school.
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
You're Polish?
My folks are.
You got any better ideas?
Mind if I ride along with you?
This has nothing to do with your fire.
I'll call it... tails.
Better than one.
I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.
I'm on duty.
Of course.
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
Is that all there is?
Something back home?
Raw deal.
Yeah.
What would your girlfriend think of that?
I don't have a girlfriend.
My point exactly.
So am I.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
You know what I'm saying here.
Hey.  I'm a professional.
Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.
What do you want?
I kill someone famous.
Then do it, asshole.
Good - be tough to the end.  Actor who plays you will want to die like hero.
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
How many victims are up there?
There are two bodies found at this point.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
Alright.
Alright?
Alright.
Okay.
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh...
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
I'm not.
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
You're ruthless.
You're not so bad yourself.
Could be Leon's.
Answer the phone.
Answer it.
That's good.
Yeah.
Well, that's great.
Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.
No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.
Promise?
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
I love you.
Tonight.
You promise?
Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
Okay.
See you later.  Good luck.
Don't be late.
Jesus Christ.
Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
I'm not moody.
Not what.  Who.
Yeah.  And he still went to the party.
You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.
Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?
You stuff sausage in it.
And what do you do with the bones?
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
Get down on your knees.
The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.
If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
Where's Czech girl?
Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm a Czech girl.
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
Look.  Do we have a problem here? There's no reason to have a problem. I'm gonna make you feel real good.  You wanna Czech girl? After I'm done with you, you won't miss her.  Now why don't you pay me?
Alright, alright - don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!
Two weeks holiday.
How much money are you carrying with you?
I have five-hundred dollars.
Can you show me?  Sir, no cameras in the FIS area!
Yes.
Is there a problem?
Two weeks.
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
He doesn't speak English.
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
Yes.  Both.
Don't speak Russian!
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!
We have no money.  Come on.
Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.
For five years I paid for your stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if I say so.  Unless you refuse, Oleg.
Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.
You said speak Czech!
How you erase this?
I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!
I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Does it hurt?
Don't want to film this?
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
Why not?
Put the camera down, Oleg.
Good idea!
Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!
The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.
Be quiet.  Watch.
Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
Credit?
Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.
No, I don't get that!
Surprise!  Surprise!
Did you hurt her?
You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money?
Milos.  Get my money!
A job?
As a plumber?!
It's easy to learn.
We started over, you can too.
You spent all the money while I was in prison?  Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!?
What are you doing here?
You've got a call.
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
Trust me, you'll want to take this call.
You want the tape?  There it is!
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
Paulie, you've got kids, right?
Don't give me that fucking shit.
What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
I'm trying to tell you.
Alright.  Go ahead.
Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
A cheap hotel.
What are you coming here to do?
I'm here for movies.
Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
Excuse me?
Thanks.  Appreciate it.
That's what it looks like to me.
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
No way!  He's mine!
Well, he killed my partner!
He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
Oh yeah?  Guess again.
Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!
Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob me!  I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this.  Now get outta here.
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
How did you start the fire this time?
I used an accelerant.
Yeah?  What kind?
Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Oh yeah, why?
Clean?
Don't blow your nose!
But you knew that, right?
He knew all along.
What??
That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.
There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
Maybe you can be his stand-in.
How long they been livin' here?
Aren't you tired?
It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
Lay down.  Stay down, Bobby.
Not good.
What the hell happened?
They were inside.  They booby trapped her apartment!
The clerk?
Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
Don't stoop to his level!
GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU, TOO!!!
Your doctor?
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
We're in negotiations, that's correct.
Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
How did they manage to do that without any communication?
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
Right. Just a sec.
Okay. 
Okay, come on down.
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
Yes?
Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.
Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
Really.
Yes.
Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
No. I never did, either.
Oh?
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
That seems very unlikely.
How?
Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
That's true.
Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
I guess it isn't.
Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
Are you reasonably awake?
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
You're kidding.
Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
Yes.
Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
He's got a point.
MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
Sure, Dave, what's up?
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
You probably also know that we found them okay.
Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
And don't you worry about it.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Yes, it is.
I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
The antenna has to be replaced.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation.
Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
Did they have any explanation for this?
Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
Are you coming to my party?
No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
When are you coming home?
In three days, darling, I hope.
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
She's in the bathroom.
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
How many days until you come home?
Thank you, Daddy.
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
Yes, Daddy.
Goodbye, Daddy.
Thank you.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
How is gregor?
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
Well, where are all of you off to?
Well, that does sound very odd.
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Are you quite sure?
Yes, really, thank you very much.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Really?
Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Fortunately, they did.
Well, I'm glad about that.
Certainly.
Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
Any clue as to what it is?
Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
When do we arrive at Clavius?
Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
What do you mean?
Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
I see.
I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
Yes, well, I wouldn't have been too concerned about it, except I've heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I've heard that ten people have died already.
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable.
I will if I can, Frank.
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
That's true.
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
That's true.
Thank you very much, Hal.
Roger.
I understand.
Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
Roger.
Hal, check all airlock doors secure.
Opening pod bay doors.
It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.
How about chargin' the battery?
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
Vodka.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
I don't give a shit who you ask.
Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
You got a real big mouth, convict.
I ain't tired yet.
Whaddya mean, buy?
Pros.
Yeah, dummy.  Money.
I never paid for it in my life.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
Hey, what kind of talk is that?
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
Goodbye.
Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
What's the matter with my place?
No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money...
Would you guys...
No time for any of that crap any more, lady... I'll rip your lungs out if you don't answer fast.
You're gonna help us take him.
No chance.
In the back.  Down the other corridor.
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...
You're done.  End of story.
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
You're crazy.
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
I got a lot to protect.
Bullshit.
What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $900.
You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
No way to start a partnership.
Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
I may call you worse than that.
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
I'm helpin' you, huh?
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
I think you better put him on ice, man.
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
We eat when I say we eat.
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...
You need five years training to handle a joint like...
I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
The bet's off.
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
Come on.
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about.  I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' ...
Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
How much?
Half a million.
Jesus.
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?
Not likely, convict.
You gonna let me keep any of it?
In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?
You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
You just drove by it.
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
Shit.
Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
Guess what?  Luther just got in line.
Musta got some primo bondsman.
Jesus Christ.  That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours.  I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...
If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.
Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
No way...
I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
Hello. And goodbye.
What about Ganz?
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
Yeah. Guess not.
I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
Why?
Luther's on the move...
Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
Don't worry about it.
If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
Well, you got to admit we come a long way.
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.
There's nothin' to talk about.
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
Yeah, I read the report...
Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
Jack?
I'll keep it in mind.
How did they get away?
They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
You couldn't get to him?
Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked up. I messed up.  Anybody could have done better, especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds.
Too bad, it would've covered your ass.  Now you're in the shit and so's the department. In case you haven't noticed, this wasn't our finest hour... I told you everyone was watchin' on this one. Maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets off a three wheel bike.
Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
Yeah.
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...
I'll help you out.
Shit.
Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
One of  em's in the slam.
So do you...been a long day.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
Doesn't look like it.
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
I'm heading out. How about you?
I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
Who gives a fuck what you think?
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
I dunno ... he's gonna call me...
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
What's wrong with that?
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
Hey, you know what I really think?
I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
I wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so I won't care for you... I wish you'd give me a little more of a chance.
That's the way I see it, too.
Call me later.
You sure you want me to?
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Guess people ought to know who I am...
Yeah, one of my favorites.
You made the front page.
Jack, are you okay?
Sure, okay, fine, no problem... See, there's this kid in jail ... First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows ...
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
No wonder you're so popular.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
So am I.
Jack, wait...
Hi, it's me...
Hiya, kid.
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
So what?
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
Where is he?
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
Tell me.
He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.
That's what I always say.
Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
Shrink major, not a shrink.
That's no bull.
In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
Shut up.
Alright, I'm coming...hold on.
Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
Can't complain.
We got a lot to talk about.
Yeah, old times.
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
You want that Indian to snap her neck?
Don't give me this, we were partners.
Billy, go ahead, break it...
No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
When?
You chickenshit punk...
You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.
First, the money.
Not bad, not bad.
Naw, right here's okay.
I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
Five bills.
Five.  On credit.
This ain't a credit business.
Give it back.
I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
Corn-i-Lius?
At your service.
Napoleon... small.
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
The case was stolen?
You know exactly where they are!
No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
I'm fucked!
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass.
They are robots!
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.
I know...
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
I brought the girl remember?
You noticed...
She's an exception..
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
Dallas. Korben Dallas.
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
I know. I was there when she arrived.
It means, "Never without my permission".
That's what I thought.
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
Of course.
Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
Leeloo's in trouble?
When is she not in trouble?
That's what I'm saying.
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
That's exactly what we are going to try and do: Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens! General? You may fire when ready.
And then?
And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.
Yes..thank God..
White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
Thank you, Mr. President.
The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!
Yes. Of course..
Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
It's all my fault.  I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
Who?
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
...So Cornelius was telling the truth!
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
Do you love her?
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
I don't have time... I need to know.
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
I would like to have died in peace...
Hey bud! Finger here.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing.
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.
Don't exist bud.
How do I look?
Like shit.
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
How many points you got left on your license?
Uh... at least fifty.
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
5'7", green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect..
...'Scuse me?
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
Vito Cornelius?
I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured...
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
...Leeloo.
Take them and put them in a safe place.
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
Time is of no importance, only life is important.
We will be ready, Lord.
I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.
Yes ma..
...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
All I want is an explanation! I just got in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab. I got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!! Now settle down and explain to me calmly..
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead!
You little sleaze bag!
...Ma???
Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands!
How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
Thanks for reminding me..
This is a police control action..
Does it get any better or what!
Uh... not really.
Crystal.
Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
I don't think this is a good time...
...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?
Yeah, very big, a giant.
We got to find the leader. Mangalores don't fight without a leader.
Not without Leeloo.
I'll be right back.
Fuck it! Hold tight!
Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.
Look, you did something that set it off. Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me exactly what you did!!
Yeah... then I sighed... like this.
What mission?
To save the world.
Where have I heard this song before?
Just one... why me?
And the third one?
You're the only one left alive...
I've had enough good news for today
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
I'm not going.
Why not?
One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive.
What is it?
I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex.. if she sees you here I'm finished.  She hates you guys. It's what killed us in the first place. Please...
Three of us will never fit in there!
Oh, yes you will...
I suppose that means "Hi" ?
Uh..you're welcome.
Cornelius..
Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you.  It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.
Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
What is... Make Love?
Learning language.
Which one?
All 900.
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
Apipoussan!
Apipoussan?
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
Uh...
...Hoppi-hoppa.
You know women normally change five times more than men.
You get that off the screen?
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
OK, you can turn around!
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
It's difficult.
The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
I told you not to read all that crap!
The wind blows... the fire burns...
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
...The rain falls...
I'm so tired...
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
Leeloo! Listen to me! I'll take you on a vacation afterwards! A real vacation, this time, for as long as you want. Come on! You can do it!
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
Exactly.
But I don't know love... I'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
Because...
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!
Uh..
You know you could hurt someone with this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..
You gotta push the little yellow button...
Actually only one cell survived..
Have you identified it?
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
Talk English Doc.
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
Wonderful!
An elephant couldn't crack it.
It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage?
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
How much time is left?
I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .
Perfect, Mr. President.
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
What you are saying is you don't know what this..thing..is.
Options.
Recommendations.
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
Gentlemen?
I'm about to, Mr. President.
Amen..
Only too well... here you must be parched..
Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
Yes, Sir!
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
I'm not at the hotel!
No... not at all.  Where are you?
Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
How's our deal coming along?
Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.
...I can't wait to be among you.
Do you know how much I missed you?
Your clothing reeks of it.
You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?
I'm not accusing you...
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
Honey, I'm not, please...
I understand.
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.
I know.
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
Tom?  Where have you been... ?
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
... What's going on?
Just do it, Amy, please, go.
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
What's going on, Tom?  What happened?
Tom...
You're sorry?  What was I supposed to think?
You couldn't?
You don't understand...
No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
I don't know what to say
You're killing me...
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
Amy...
What?
Tom... she's dead.
I just talked to her.
Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.
There's nothing harder.
Snuff?
What you see is what I got, mister.
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
What are you talking about?
The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
Bullshit.
I'm telling you...
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
Dino...
Nobody knows anything.
I promised him to Machine.
What can I do for you today?
A fellow investor.
Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
And they are?
I'll consider it.
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
Machine.
We can do that.
Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit?  Very good.
I'm camera shy.
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.
Machine's in?
Brooklyn.  Don't be late.
Right here.
Where are the women?
Sure.
Take out your gun!
Look, I don't know what this...
Shut up, cunt!  Do exactly as I say, or I'll put this arrow through your throat.
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
Bring the film, or we kill him.
How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
Move it, dirtbag... !
You betrayed us.
Alright, Tom.
What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
There are reasons for the way we do things here.
I figured you share information.
We do.
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
Why don't they come to me?
This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
I'm not so sure about this.
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
It's good what you're doing.
Eddie.
Yeah, who's this?
I know what you did.
What?
Who is this.
You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...
You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.
One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
How'd you find me here?
Fuck you!
What do you want?
Who is Machine?
I told you, I don't know.
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows.
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
Yeah.
How much did he pay you?
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
Something like that.
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
What the fuck do you want from me?
Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!
Why?
Because we're going there.
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
Tell me what happened.
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
Nobody saw you bring her in?
There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
What did you do with her body?
Show me.
You got absolute zero.
Show me where you buried her.
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
Where?  Show me where.
I fucking don't know.  What do you think... we weren't burying treasure.  We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it.  We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as mine.
Don't think I won't.
Easy enough for you.
I never killed anyone.
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
What do you want?  You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?
The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?
Look, you cocksucker...
Fuck you!
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
You are a private investigator?
That's right.
Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
I was well compensated.
Never mind how I found you.
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
They're no friends of mine.
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name.  Her mom remembers her.
Shut up.
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
Shut your mouth and drive!
Did it get him off, huh, watching them cut her up?  Tell me, because I really want to understand.  Did he jerk off to it?  You watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched... ?
You're asking me why?
I'm asking.
Isn't it incredibly obvious?
Because he could.  He did it because he could.  What other reason were you looking for?
Fuck you.
You'll get it when we get there.
Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?
Yeah... guess so.
Pardon me?
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
I'll risk it.
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.
Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
Max.
Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.
You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
Not quite.
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
How much?
How much do you make now?
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
Sounds good, pops.
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.
There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.
Snuff films.
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
Twenty-five.
Where are your parents?
I don't know, where are yours?
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
A daughter.
So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
Good question.
A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.
Specialty product.
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
Alright, I get the picture.
I'm a working stiff, pops.
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.
It's their Presidential Suite.
Great.
Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
Who is he, his name?
Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself "Machine," that's what they call him.  Machine.
What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?
"Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
Nope.
It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
I try to be.
Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
Thank you.
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
You are highly recommended.  Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.
My condolences.
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
He succeeded.
We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.
I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.
Just curious.
There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
Cash, stock certificates, and this...
This is a movie showing a girl being murdered.  She's sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife...  I only watched what I could.
Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a "snuff film."  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such thing, I can assure you.
No.
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
Of course.  But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
I told you I can't, not yet.
You don't have any other choice.
No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
It won't work like that.
Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.
You've found missing persons before.
Nothing remotely like this.
I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
I'm not positive this means anything.
The checks were for odd amounts...
I'm here.
Do you think the film could have cost that much?
For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
You told me to look, so I looked.
You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
I hope it's nothing serious.
Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
Fine...
How will I get it to you?
If you have a pencil and paper, I'll tell you how to send it.
Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
I don't understand, who are... ?
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
No.
They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
No.
She just seemed... depressed... ?
What was she running from?
I don't know.
If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?
Yes.
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
Why do you think he did it?
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
I didn't mean to...
You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
I had to ask.  I apologize.
Of course.
Okay.
We're all like that.
Are you religious?
No.
You should be.
It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
There wasn't one.  The police looked.
Do you think the police did a good job?
I don't know.  I think so.
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
If the police focused their search in her room, her belongings, well that'd be only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place.
Will you let me look?
My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?
Yes.
It's been six years.
What am I supposed to do?  Forget her?  Time heals all wounds, right?  She's all I think about, and I've learned to live with that.  But, you want the truth... the real truth? If I had a choice... if I had to choose, between her being out there, living a good life and being happy, and me not knowing; never finding out what happened to her...  ... or her being dead and me knowing...  I'd choose to know.
I remember.  You just left...
I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...
She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
Who is this... ?
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
No...
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I'm sorry.  It happened a month after she ran away.  She's been dead all this time...
You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
Yes.  I remember her.
I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?
I'll do what I can.
None too discreet, is he?
Certainly, Senator.  If I can ever be of further assistance.
Cash.
No, you may not.
Okay.  Fine.
Certainly, sir.
What's wrong?
Kincaid and Joey died last night.
It was bad.
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
I can't find him.
It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
Yeah, or turn you into toast.
I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
I'm sure they're around.
Yeah, I'm not so sure.
You could do worse.
Sounds like a game show host to me.
Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
When I used to have nightmares.  I brought my friends in to help me.  Until they all started dying.
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
That obvious, huh?
Then you saw him, too?
Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...
You're his sister, right?
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
I know.  Uh...Alice.
It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.
Kristen's story really got to her.
Extra money, huh?
Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.
Is there something we can do?
I don't think so.  I guess this is my own war.
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.
Then what else can we do?
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
Who?
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
You just feel sorry for me.
Cut that shit out.  Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side.
It's okay, we're just about there.
You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
Save it for later.  Come on!
It was Freddy.
Enough of that crap.
I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...
Earth to Alice...
Excuse me, ladies.  I'll just be a moment.
She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
So?
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
She knew she was gonna die.
How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
What else?  You ever look over this town's history?  Not a safe place to be a teenager.  Anyway, if I'm next, watch your back.
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
You're just tired.  Don't think I haven't noticed your not sleeping.  That has to stop, honey.
Your distraught.  It'll help...
Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
Avoid-all-contact-day.
What?
When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.
Oh God!  He killed them!
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
It's no story.  It happened.  Freddy's real and he's back.
It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
I told you you can't help.  This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
You just stay put.  You need rest.
Don't worry, honey
What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him.
And ours.  It's our grandchild.
What are you talking about?  My "condition"?...
Huh?
My name is...
How did you know that?
Oh...I'm sure that's not true.  I'll bet she's very worried about you.  I would be.
Who said I...wait, what?
Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
He's inside you, where he hides.
It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me.
I know.
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
He'll show up.  C'mon, what's really wrong?
No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.
Yeah...I guess.
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
There you go.  Love you.
Me too.
I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
No.  A deal's a deal.
To take a picture.
You sure you don't want a ride to work?
It's just across the park.
Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.
Very funny.
Alice...
Since my little girl became a mom...
You disappointed in me?
No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
I've got to go.
But Dad --
Now.
Had kind of a long night.
Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.
No, the Dan part was nice...
Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.
There aren't any little boys on your floor.
He must've wandered up from the children's ward.  I just wondered what was wrong with him.
When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
Why don't you two stick to reality.
I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
Krueger is reality.
And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams.
That's the only reason you're alive...
Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
If they actually bothered to bury her.
Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
So did Dan.
I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
Greta, come on.  One burger with me?
That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?
She must've fallen asleep at the table...
Mark!
Nobody thinks that.
It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
My baby!
What, you named it already?
I don't know!
I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
Then we'll find another way.
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
Meaning?
Empty plot.  Memorial stone.  Vacant. They never did put her under.  Cool, huh?
No shit.
She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
Next life.  Oh, what's that?
Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?
Oh, he was this ancient guy I read about who like, killed his kids 'cause they didn't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should.
I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
Makes you look like a nun--
Yeah...
That means they're gonna give me the key to the pool so I can lock up when I'm done.
Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
Nah.  It's getting too cold for me, and my wonderful mother will kill me if I screw up my hair.  She's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night.
I want to talk about the baby.
Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
Two hours a day, six days a week.
Faint.
I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
I can't listen to this.
Stick around, please?
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
How is he - ?
Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!
That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
You may not <u>win</u> them.  But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!
Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
I'd sooner swim!
But if they <u>do</u>?
I don't know.
I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
So they caught up with you, too?
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
Huh?
I might have a son like <u>that!</u>
I guess.
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
A lot of people think like that.
'His' side?  I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!
Sounds like it!  Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing.
Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
'Us?'
Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
I think you're right.
Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
Listen!  Hear that?
Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
The sound again?
Somewhere down there?
We'll have to look for them later.
I'm with <u>you!</u>
Oh it does???
What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
What about down?
What???
Right at our one-eyed friend!
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
Yes, Griff?
All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen report exterior damage minor.
Something wrong?
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
What????
Wonderful!
That's wonderful, Carl!  Reef thinks they can clear the Shark bow so we can pull ourself loose!
Radiation level...constantly rising...
Anything ---
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
What about time...?
High-intensity arcs will burn, submerged.  And millions of volts...discharged in random directions...
The North Pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all - the Earth itself!
What direction does the system indicate?
There's got to be an explanation!
There is.  I believe our friend...Cyclops... is returning to life!
As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.
I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
I met Dr. Kent, once.
Who with?
Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -
Huh?
I think I should have joined the Air Force!
After torpedo room:  Report!
Take a look.
That's what I said!
But - what can we accomplish?
We can <u>ram</u> him!
It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
And we're at safe maximum depth already....  Stop engines!
If we could get inside the saucer - use our torches - maybe we could cut the Shark loose?
Come where?
Tell me something:  Why can <u>I</u> hear you, when the others couldn't?
- for horrors like yourself?
Your friend was to remain where he was!
I am afraid not.  Therefore -
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study.  We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
Of course.  But it is time to be- gin the return voyage --
Obviously.
<u>That</u> might be a <u>little</u> <u>rough</u>!
Thank you.
The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
Or, perhaps, until he gets us?
But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
Toward the Pole!
All right - go to it.
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
No. Black.
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
Always has been.
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
Who?
Who?
You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
You don't believe me?
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
Has anybody offered to buy it?
As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
No.
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman. In a year or two, you won't recognize this town.
Same old shit.
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
Yeah. I know about that.
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
Tell me.
Chub says you're fired.
He's a Selectman. The town. He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office. I'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car. They're town property.
I plan to. Soon.
This spring.
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
Yes.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
Yeah. I know. The custody suit thing was just my getting back at her. I'm not as dumb as I look. Whatever you say. I love my daughter.  I'll send you the five hundred.
Yeah.
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
No, of course not. Just say it, that's all.
You can't buy Wade off.
We bought you.
That was me.
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
Guaranteed, eh?
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
Damn straight!
If you get it?
You might not kill it.
You think so.
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
Mmm.
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
Wonderful!
Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
You played for the Sox?
Double A. New Britain.
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
Really.
Hmm.
What happened?
Ruined my arm. Brought me along too fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking arm, I used to think. Then I realized it had to be somebody's fucking arm.
This way.
Deers have ears too.
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
Where's that gun you were bragging on today?
Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? 
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
Gordon, he's always got some angle working. He wants to keep Twombley happy, I'm his boy.
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
Right!
In the chest.
No, I mean whereabouts.
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
Yeah.
Where'd you get the blood?
What blood?
On your sleeve.
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
What?
Saw him do it?
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.
Yeah.
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
Lawford?
Out of this fucking job. This job sucks. Working outside in the winter sucks.
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
Open the door. We're late.
What do you mean I got money? I'm as broke as you.
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
I don't care. They're out.
Can't you see... look out there. Nobody's got their porch lights on anymore. It's too late. Those Hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble. See, they put shaving cream all over that mailbox there. They chopped down Herb Crane's new bushes. Little bastards. Jesus H. Christ.
Do what?
You know.
Break stuff?
I guess they're stupid.
Did you do that when you were a kid?
Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
To us it was.
But it's not funny now.
It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
I bet you did lots of bad things.
What are you talking about?
I just think you used to be bad.
No. She doesn't talk about you anymore.
I don't want to.
It's not that.
What then?
Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't mess this up anymore than it's already been messed up. Join the other kids. Do that and before you know it you'll be as happy as a goddamned clam.
No.
No what?
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
I called Mommy.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
See, I knew you'd be mad.
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
Well, I guess I am. I planned this, I planned all this, you know. I mean, it's sort of pathetic, but I planned it. You shouldn't have called your mother.  C'mon, we're gonna call her before she leaves.
Yes.
That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
It's pretty old.
It belongs to Pop.
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
No.
What do you want, then?
Nothing.
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
I want to go home.
I know.
You're a policeman.
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
I want to go home.
Okay, let's go home, then.
Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
Where's the plow?
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
Huh?
What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
You don't want the extra police pay?
I'm not saying that.
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
Fuck you.
That's what I love about a small town. You know everybody.
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
Huh?
I figured you already heard.
Twombley, Jesus. We got to get moving: I got to get up there. How would I know? C'mon, you drive. We'll take my truck.
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
You mean Twombley?
Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
Like hell.
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
Let's get to the top and talk to Jack first. He'll know what happened. He fucking better. If this coulda been avoided, I'll put that kid's ass in a sling.
It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
I'm fine, fine.
You Rolfe?  I remember you from high school. You're a teacher now? Harvard?
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
On what you pay me?
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
So?
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
Want to buy?
I won't. You interested?
Always count on old Wade for a good screwing. Why should I always pay more, sell cheap? Why should you guys make all the money. You and Mel and Jack. Right's right.
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
The key, Wade.
Where's Jill?
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake.
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
I'm not making it any worse. You are. Me and Jill could've worked this thing out. It's normal, it's even normal for me to get a little touchy about it. Believe it or not. How do you think this makes me look, treating her like some tragic victim or something?
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
We should talk.
We've done all our talking, Wade.
It's just...
Yeah, lots.
You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
Did you get his number?
I know who it is.
Mel Gordon.
From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
How's she doing?
Okay. She's fine.
You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay? I'm off.
See you tomorrow, maybe.
Yeah.
Said what?
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
Yeah. I mean that.
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
Jack doesn't need money.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
You knew me as a kid.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
What way?
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.
Oh, Wade.
You've been married twice --
It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
Alright. I'll think about it.
Good.
The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
Think they're alright?
I don't know for Christ's sake!
Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
There's a furnace.
When did she die?
How's that?
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
Yes. Here's your ticket.
You get the hell out of my house now, asshole. And know this -- you are going to be a lucky asshole if I haven't got you fired before the day is out. I can do it with one phone call, and I'm pissed enough to do it now!
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
He's asleep. We were up very late.
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
Something about my father?
Can't it wait, then?
You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
This town sucks.
That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
Jack?
The other guy.
Where... how'd you hear that?
No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.
It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
He got his deer yet?
No, he's out now. Somewhere on the mountain. I'd stay away from him if I were you. He's real pissed.
Atta-go.
Nothing.
You no-good pup!
Sleeping.
You remember Margie Fogg?
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
Yeah.
She's coming.
Is there something wrong with the phone?
In the living room.
Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
Nah-nah-naw! You done done finally done it! Like a man done it. Done it right. I love you, you mean sonofabitch!
Love! I'm made of love!
Everything you know is from me.
Yeah.
Bang!
You and me.
Crawl!
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
Wade?
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
There was something. It happened up your way.
Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm calling because I need you to listen. You're supposed to be a smart guy. You're a professor. I got this theory. Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot but he did.
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
Who?
No shit.
You think Jack shot him?
Well, it was an accident.
The night before the shooting.
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
What happened?
A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer. You know, 'cause of Jill.
Yeah, I guess.
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
No thanks. I don't drink.
Yeah. I forgot.
What about her?
Well, do you still plan to get married?
Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
Want to know what I think happened?
That it wasn't an accident.
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
I don't know. You tell me.
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
A hunting accident is perfect.
Shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. Jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled.
Not particularly.
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
Yeah.
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
Well, I never heard that one.
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office.
For what?
Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.
Yeah, no duh.
I'm sure he's busy.
Alice...
You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
Back at The Fishbowl?
I know, Mom.  It was great... really.
I'm sorry, honey.
Your father never means to be so...
Some kids were teasing you?
Yes dear?
I'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier.
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
Yeah. Do you know what the word &quot;asshole&quot; means.
That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.
You are a resilient man, Mr.
Hey, you guys back already?
It was the experience of a lifetime.
How `bout a hug for the old man.
Daddy...
Alice... I...
Been better, Dad... You?
It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.
Okay, I'm slowing us down.
Did we warn them off?
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
The world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner.
Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
Got it.
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
Okay, you're aerated. To dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump. There's no switch in Avionics so you'll have to cross the wires. There should be five wires, just to your left. Do you see them?
Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
Put your pilot on.
Got it.
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
Uh, Tower, we got a problem up here.
Holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you're making demands.
That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
This doesn't make sense.
I prefered the terrorists.
That's game, set, and match. There's nothing to do, except call the Chief Justice.
Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
Okay. Also, I want you to put our bases in Turkey on alert, and have the Kitty Hawk prepare a retaliatory air strike.
If fired upon, tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage.
To swear you in as President.
Why?
Because it is my duty.
My loyalty was never to my country.
About goddamn time.
Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
Roger.
Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.
Dead.
Nine.
why did they do that?
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.
We're not going to make it.
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
Where are we now?
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
No! If we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another Entebe.  The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and...  refuels in mid-air. Call the White House.
Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
Romeo Tango Zulu1 this is Tower.
Tower, here.
The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're all cleared?  You can follow me then.
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
A dubious distinction, no?
I guess it depends on your perspective.
Conference rooms, though some have other functions.  The one up front doubles as an emergency medical center.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
Scared. We're scared.
Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
What do you want with us?
Come on, Alice.
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
I know he left you behind.
My husband is a very courageous man.
Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.
Yes
Why? Do you enjoy it?
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
How can you? I mean they're people.
That was war.
So is this.  Come now, you're upsetting the little one.
No.
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
No. But since I only have a few of your staff left to kill, perhaps I will start with your family instead... Gibbs.
Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
You'll do it?
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
Good. Good.
You don't like seeing people get hurt. Now in morality, that is a virtue. In politics, however, that is weakness.  You were a hostage to everyone else *                    long before you were a hostage to
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
If you put down the gun, I promise not to drop her on the way down.
Hold on, Alice.
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
Twenty minutes?
You heard me.  You. Congress and cabinet heads.
Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.
They've gotta be joking.
Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.
Gravity.
We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
They've cut communication, and I spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives. My only solution ran out of batteries.
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
Got it.
Yes, sir.
That isn't necessary.
No, Mr. President.  It can't.
Rose, I don't have time for this.
She's a big girl.  She understands.
And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and I'm already three hours behind Schedule.  What do you want me to do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off because I'm a family man?
What?
I miss you. And I miss her.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
I wish it were that easy...
I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
This promise isn't subject to Congressional approval.
Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.
Both of you.
You haven't even driven a car since you took office.
The fax machines.
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
No. I thought about this, Mr.
White House Situation room.
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
Then tell me there's a rescue operation underway.
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
But this is different, sir. You're the President.
Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that.  I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office.  We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood?
We're under attack.
Where's my family?
We're handling it, sir.
But...
Two... THREE. GO!
Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
who can I say is calling?
This is the President.
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
Thank you for calling the white House...
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
He and the NRA don't like the wording.
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.
Other way around, sir.
Right... Christ I'm tired.  Do me a favor and keep me away from the press.
Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.
That's my job.
Yes, sir.
Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?
I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
A MiG? Where the hell are we?
Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
How long's it been since you flew, sir?
Twenty-five years.
They better. Fuel's almost gone.
DO YOU SEE TEEM?
We're hooked. Hove into position.
Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
Commissioner.
I just wish it was that simple.
That just doesn't make any sense.
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
You've made your point, Commissioner. There's only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that's Clarence Oveur.  He's got a lunar flight today.  I want him pulled.  Jacobs, pull Oveur!
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
Commissioner, Aquarius.
Felt like a large asteroid.
What is it, Mary?
Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.
Accelerators down.
You better check it, Unger.
You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.
Sir?
You better take this.
Te...!
That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk.
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.
Ask Simon.
There's nothing wrong with me!
Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.
Who's that, Ted?
Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car accident.  He hasn't been the same since.
Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.
Let me by, Elaine.
I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
Not now, Elaine!
Ted!
Elaine, we have to go back.
We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
I'd use the word insane.
Elaine, what's going on?
Ted, please be careful.
Not now, Elaine.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
That might be the news we've been waiting for.
Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
You mean...
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.
Now!
Compute!
Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...
I mean for Ted.
You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
Is that a good sign, Doctor?
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
Simon.
And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
I'm so excited, Simon.
I guess this is a first for you.
No, I've been excited before.
So mentally ill?
Don't be too long.
I think so.
That's my girl.
Roger.
Can't we change course?
We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.
Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?
Maybe.
Yes, sir.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
Roger.  You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit.
Negative.
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
That's not possible.
Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.
That's okay, ROK.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
Go ahead.
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
Request; life support systems check.
Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
Look, a man can make an honest mistake!! Anyway, she was asking for it!  They're all asking for it all the time!!
Scraps.
Can I hold him?
He's a boy dog.
Yeah.
Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his back, Jimmy?
We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...
Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.
I don't want to hear that word!
Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
All right.  Here.
What...?
I don't want to live anymore.
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
I'm sure.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
Just poached on toast.  Over.
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
Poached!  Not over!  Over!
Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?
Sixteen 'C', why?
He's carrying a bomb.
A b...
What should I say?
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
Do you think it's necessary to explain <u>everything</u>?
Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
Yes.
Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
Don't try to stop me!
That's right, Striker.  And we're getting married when we return.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
Then Elaine was right.
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
You don't have to excuse yourself.  I'm a nurse.  I understand.
I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
No, I mean your head.  Sit down.  I'll take a look at it.  I'm a nurse.
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time.
That's very nice of you. Thank you.
Thank you. Cream?
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me 'Bubbles.'
No. I'm all alone.
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
Something about a plane with no pilot?
Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
Surely you can't be serious.
I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
Well, I flew single-engine fighters in the Air Force, but this plane has four engines. It's an entirely different kind of flying...<u>all</u> <u>together</u>!!!
Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
Surely there must be something you can do.
Well...not for another two hours.
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
That's right.
Yes. Yes, of course.
A hospital? What is it?
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
Certainly.
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.
He had fish.
Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
He had fish, too.
Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
No.
I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.
Ted!
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
You expect me to believe that?
But if you'll just give me...
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
I remember everything. All I have are memories.
That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past!
Headquarters!? What is it?
Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?
Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
And a little ice.
And a little ice!
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan.
I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before.
Yes?
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
The gear is down.
Uh-huh.
Hello.
Who wants to be first?
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can.
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
All right, he's on final now! Put out all runway lights except niner.
Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
What is it?
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
Here.
I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my buns every night.
I'm Randy.
Oh, I'd love to.
Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about. We'll get back to you very quickly.
Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
Huh?
Huh?
Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
Yes?
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
No. No thank you.
It's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. But that's not important right now. The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio. Do you know anything about planes?
Would you go up, please?
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
You've got me all wrong.  I don't charge money for something that I myself find pleasurable...
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
Todd?  Todd doesn't know either.
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
A virgin.  I find that very arousing...
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
I like my horizons narrow.
Yeah...
That's right.
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
Ss'ai k'ss?  Perfect.
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
She did, did she?  Well, she was wrong.  Excuse me, I have to change.
Show me.
You don't have squat.
You ever try to make a case in Slagtown?  The list of Newcomer informants is about as long as the list of Mexican war heroes...
I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do.
Lay off, asshole.
I may be an asshole, but at least I'm a real detective, not some outer shit space thing.
Yes...
I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
That's right.  He and I, along with seven or eight others.  Listen, gentlemen, I will be happy to assist you in any way I can -- unfortunately, at the moment, I'm overdue at another function.
No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
Here?
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
I am George.
My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.
Gesundheit.  You don't mind if I stick to George, do you?
That is exactly so.  It is like your name... Sykes.  I'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that it sounds like "ss'ai k'ss", two words in my language which mean "excrement" and "cranium".
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
Nice signal, dickwad!
There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
Yes.
Well, there's a thing about partners, about being somebody's partner.  You do for each other. And other people's rules don't mean shit.  It's the rules set up between the two of you, that's all that counts.  Understand?  Okay.  Well, my friend and partner was shot last night and I'm after the shitbag that did it.  As my partner, I'm asking you to respect me and help me find him.
Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get something straight.  You agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right?
Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?
Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
Nothing?
Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?
A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?
And still it fits?
How the hell do you know that?
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.
So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that "possible" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.
I believe I should interview the widow alone.
Why the hell--?!  Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.
A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley.
Aw-right.  What about the other guy?
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
Did you talk to him?
We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley.
Why'd I do what?
Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...
My partner is dead!  Because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared into a rathole down in Slagtown, where he's home and dry, 'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody says nothing...
At the end of the bar.
Uh, Matthew...
Back off, George.
Screw me?  That can't be right.
Your mother mates out of season.
That's very colorful.  But see -- now I've got a problem.  I don't seem to be getting much cooperation from you, Porter.  So I guess we're gonna have to take this little session down to my office, ya know?
In the camps, we were lodged four to a room.  The selection process was entirely random.  We did not get to stay with our friends... or families...
Yeah, sure.  I knew that...
Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.
This is mole.  It's good.
I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
Yeah, that's it.  Say it slow.
Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.
When will Strader return?
Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.
Was.  Divorced.
We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
It's like having an eleventh finger removed.  It hurts like hell, but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place.
I appreciate your honesty, George.
In the other man's rectum.
No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
You humans are very curious to us. You invite us to live among you, in an atmosphere of equality we've never known before.  You lay before us a beautiful green world, full of freedoms and opportunities... You give us ownership of our lives for the first time... and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves: to live by the rules... rules that aren't made to keep one people subordinate to another, but rules that exist to preserve equality.  You aspire to very high ideals here.
Don't count on me, George.  I never had any ideals.
A man, a human, was wiring it to your car.  I didn't get a good look at him.  I must call my wife...
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
To the... to the beach?
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
Thank you.
Nothing.
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
How potent?
Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.
I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot stop this without you.
No, George -- you're missing the point.  The drug is evidence.  We need to have the evidence, ya know?
Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?
The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.
Why?  What's the big goddamn deal?
Fuck procedure.
Ss-ai!
It'd be for your own good.  I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book.  ... Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going.  I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective.
There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
Do what?!  George-- ?!
... It's Harcourt.
Harcourt is dead.
No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...
Tell me about it...
We can't let him get away.
But there's no more drug.
You understand that.  But how many others will?
You look very good.
What is it?
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
Only holds five.
No... two.
Well, one of the men didn't like him so much...
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
Who else can I ask around here?
Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.
I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off.
Yes it is.  Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there.  I don't know how these fellas do it.
... They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon.
For you, anything.
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
I'm sorry, Matt.  Nothing here seems to be matching up...
Sure.  Just a minute.
Ss'kya'ta'.
What's that?
Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
Yeah, I heard of it.
Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.
Yeah... he was one Martin Helder. White male, twenty-seven.  Let's see... wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction, a couple for sale of a controlled substance. Oh yeah, and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock.
Yeah.
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
Yeah, I'll bet.
You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
Did he find anything?
Departmental policy.
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
Don't tell me what to think.
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--
But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
Shit, if Kristin had to get married where I could afford it, we'd be holding the reception at Buddy's Burgers.
Whatever gave you that idea?
I got him.  Don't get pinned.
I can't!  Do you mind!
Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
Can't lock up...
Talk to me, Hudson.
Uh, seems to be in front and behind.
Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.
Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!
Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.
Let's go.  Pull 'em out.
Say again?  All after incinerators?
Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...
Yes.  That follows.
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
Could it be intelligent?
Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.
How long until it blows?
I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.
What?
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
WE'RE NOT LEAVING!
She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.
In seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska.
You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...
Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.  I'm sorry.
Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.
Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
You are a head case.  Have a donut.
Hear me out...
I was reamed, steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys...and now you want me to go back out there?  Forget it.
Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
If I go.
If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...
Spare me, Burke.  I've had my psych evaluation this month.
No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
She's right.
Why not?
They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?
Bullshit!
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
Corporal Hicks!?
This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command.  Right?
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
Now, wait a second --
You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
Dead on all channels.
It's insured.
PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
Shit.  Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there.
The structure seems intact.  They have power.
Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?
I don't know.
So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
So?  So?
All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
Forget it.
Yes, Hicks?
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved.
He's coming in.  I feel safer already.
Okay, stand by in operations.  Let's go.
Alive?
You tell me.  I only work here.
Sure, Hicks.
Not that tunnel, the other one!
Are you finished?  You okay?
Aye-firmative.
I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.
Do it!
Let's get these things lit.
Fuckin' A!
About seventeen days.
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
Yeah.  I've noticed.
The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
Let's waste him.  No offense.
We didn't miss anything.
All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!
We ain't going anywhere.
Don't be long, Ellen.
Fuck you.
Anytime.  Anywhere.
Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal!
Hudson, give us a break.
You're just reading me.
Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.
She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.
Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here.
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
Oh, right!  Right!  With those things running around.  No way.
What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals.
Just get back here!
It's readin' right.  Look!
Yeah.  What?
Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'
Terrible.
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
Just a couple of days.  Do you feel up to a visitor?
Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
Why not?
Because you'll be gone soon, like the others.  Like everybody.  You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone.
They're dead.
Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
You promise?
Cross my heart.
And hope to die?
The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
You're really something, ace.
I'm sorry, Newt.
I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
My mommy always said there were no monsters.  No real ones.  But there are.
No, it's different, honey.
Did you ever have a baby?
Yes.  A little girl.
Where is she?
Gone.
You mean dead.
I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
I know, honey.  Me too.
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
Newt, I want you to hang on, now.  Hang on tight.
Right here, baby.  Right here.
That's right.
Yes, honey.  I think we both can.
It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.
Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
...because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew, within twelve hours of hatching...
What are you talking about. What people?
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking!

Indeed.
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
His Grace is very angry with you.
What do you mean?
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
Is there a part for me?
No.
How do you know?
Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
Why not?
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
Where?
What's that?
A brothel.
Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk.
Perhaps.
You might be disappointed.
Why?
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste.
You were sublime.
What did you think of the music?
Extremely clever.
Meaning you didn't like it.
Don't bother!
Don't bother.
I'll be right back.
Is her mother still lying on the floor?
No, she's fine.
What??
I assume she's the virtuoso in that department. There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that.
Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.
But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
Hardly.
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
You have leave to try.
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
Humiliated?
How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
I want to go!
Where?
I want to go back to Vienna.
Now?
Yes!
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
What are you talking about?
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
Fartsbishop!
Why not?
Why? People fart backwards.
Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
Yes, you are. You're very sick.
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
Em iram! Em iram!
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
Ui-vol-i-tub!
What?
Tish-I'm-tee.
Eat
Yes.
Eat my - ah!
Of course.
Oh, leave me alone.
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
Oh yes? You always know everything.
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
You borrowed money from your mother?
Yes!
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.
What's the matter with you?
Tell them to go!
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
Yes!
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
Wolfi, I think your father's tired. I'll cook us something here.
What does she want?
I don't know.
Well, ask her!
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
Stanzi!
No, it's right he should hear. I'm sick to death of it. We can't do anything right for you, can we?
Wolfi.
Yes, my love?
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
What?
Your father is dead.
I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?
Why not? Half the house!
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
Shut up! I'll not let you put anything in my hand until I see some money.
No one.
I heard voices.
I'm not telling you.
Why not?
You'd think I was mad.
Why?
Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
Give me two more weeks. Please.
I can't write it!
Why not?
Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all word. I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. Please, please!
Madame. How can I help you?
That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
I understand.
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
No, sir. This is my own idea.
I see.
Originals?
Yes.
Oh, thank you, sir!
Tonight?
Alone.
But! I'm a married woman!
Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague, that is the price.
Should we stay here? It's a charming room. I love these candlesticks. Were they here earlier? I didn't notice them I suppose I was too nervous.
Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
Why you?
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
He's not going to work on this anymore. It is making him ill. Please.
Madame, I will respect his. He asked me to stay here.
Ah. Well. Ah,  I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?
Not at all.
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
He's doing his best.
I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
Money! Money!
You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor.  Who are you?
Oh, yes.
When, may I ask?
But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
Do you hear him? Do you?
Be careful!
Adorable!
Behold!
Hey!
Behold!
Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
Gertrude!
Gertrude!
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
Michael, please! I'm sure you will find her most willing, Herr Mozart. She's really very excited. She's been preparing all morning.
Yes. He is a little strange.
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
Wine?
Who was your teacher?
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.
You are cattivo, Court Composer.  I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.
Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
Cattivo again, Court Composer. Well, tell him, Mozart. Name us a German virtue.
Your Highness.
Yes?
And the result satisfies.
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
Sire.
Well. There it is.
Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
Why not?
Oh?
Of course not.
I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
Really?
Yes?
Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson.
No, no, please! It is not a holy relic.  You know we have met already? In this very room. Perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old.  He was giving the most brilliant little concert here. As he got off the stool, he slipped and fell. My sister Antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did? Jumped straight into her arms and said, Will you marry me, yes or no?
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely.
Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
Ah-ha.
I think so, Sire, yes.
Yes, indeed.
Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!
Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?
Enchanted, Madame.
Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.
Twenty-six.
Well, my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna.
Thank you, Sire!
Ah! By all means.
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
Would you tell me why?
Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
I think you are rather innocent, my friend. In these dangerous times I cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece.
Ah, love again.
I have no idea.
Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
Twenty, sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives.
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
Sire, the whole opera is finished. Do you know how much work went into it?
I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
Very small pay, I imagine. I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer. Say, an opera in German for our National Theatre.
In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people.
Yes, what about him?
He's here.
Ah-ha. Well. There it is. Good.
Is she not here?
I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!
Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.
How is your financial situation?
It couldn't be better.
That's not what I hear.
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
They say you're in debt.
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
How many pupils do you have?
Yes.
How many?
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
This one will.
Why not?
It's a secret.
You don't have secrets from me.
It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.
Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!
I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
Mine?
I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
She does. She says I sleep all day.
Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'
Good morning, sir.
What have you got for me today? Let me see.
I will, sir.
Bene! Bene!
Bene.
Do any pupils come to the house?
Not that I've seen.
Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
Really? What is it he's writing?
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?
Yes what?
In there, sir.
Why? What has happened?
Where?
Is he working?
Is he working?
I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
Opera? Opera!
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
That's right.
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
What?
They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.
Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
Sssh! Stay here.
Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.
That kind of music should be punishable by death.
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
I tell you I picked up a snake in Dresden last week - twelve foot long  - folds up to six inches, just like a paper fan. It's a miracle.
German!
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
Wolfi!
What is this?
What?
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
Can I see it?
No.
Why not?
Well, we can.
So let me see it. Where is it?
And which one of them do you want me to teach?
What? Ha-ha! That's funny - I like it. Which one, eh? You're a funny fellow.  Hannah! Come this way.
Madame.
This is Herr Mozart, my dear. The young man Herr Salieri recommended to teach our Gertrude. Where is she?
Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?
Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.  How long have you been playing, Fraulein?
Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?
What for?
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.
