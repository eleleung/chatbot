Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
Cameron.
Let me see what I can do.
That's because it's such a nice one.
Where?
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
Tons
I was?
Then that's all you had to say.
But
The "real you".
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
No
Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
Expensive?
It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
Hi, Joey.
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
Can you at least start wearing a bra?
What do you think?
What's normal?
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
In 9th.  For a month
Why?
But you hate Joey
Why didn't you tell me?
I just wanted --
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
It's just you.
What if she never starts dating?
But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
It's just a party. Daddy.
Just for a minute
Why?
The prom?  Kat has a date?
Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
So they tell me...
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
How many people go here?
You burn, you pine, you perish?
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
That's what I just said
Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
It's a lung cancer issue
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
Yeah -- we'll see.
So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
It's off. The whole thing.
You get the girl.
What do you think?
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
How much?
What?
Forget her sister, then.
Do what?
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
Does this conversation have a purpose?
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
Block E?
An attempted slit.
You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
Neither has his heterosexuality.
I didn't have a choice.
I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
Oh, right.  Friday.
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
And why would I do that?
Seven-thirty?
I'm fine. I'm
I just need to lie down for awhile
I know, just let me sleep
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
I told you
Sure, I do
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
What?
Were you in jail?
Maybe.
Then why'd you ask?
Why'd you lie?
This.
My father wouldn't approve of that that
I'm gettin' there
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
What are you doing here?
I heard there was a poetry reading.
You 're so --
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
So what did I have an effect on ?
Try lookin' at it from this angle
I dazzled him with my wit
So what's your excuse?
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
You never disappointed me.
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
You know what I mean
No, I won't go with you
You tell me.
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
So what I want doesn't matter?
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
Funny.
Parts of it.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Just smack her now.
Right.
We're your guys.
Yeah.
Touch of the flu.
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
No.  The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people.  I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.
Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
A waste...?  Let me tell you something, Arojaz.  If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his.
I know.
I find that hard to believe.
I don't want you to wait for me.
You don't usually ask.
May I ask by whom?
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
There must be a passage to that other ocean.
I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing.
I'm not bargaining!
Good!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves!
To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.  A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
Look out of that window.
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
All of them created by people like me.
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
He understands.
Ask him if he will help.
You did the same to your God!
With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
How can you be so certain?
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
Damn God!
Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
Give me absolution.
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
Thank you.
Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
And what do you think Mendez?
Come over here.
You must be mad...!
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
We're lost!
You bloody...
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
You're right.  Let the men decide.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Is this true, Brother Buyl?
He must be replaced.
Because he is not afraid of me.
Here.  I have your money.
Oh, sure.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
What's your cut?  How much?
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
No.  No way.
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
Give me another one, please.
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
Yes, but he was a cop.
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
They won't until this is over.
Divorced.
Do you live alone?  I've been in these clothes since...the killings.  Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?
So...the station is empty?
Yeah.  This way.
Did you ever turn tricks before?
No.
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...
I'm sorry.
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
I don't want to drag you down with me.
C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
Yeah, sure.  Beep me when you're ready for the press conference.
I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
What was that, Korfin?
Vodka tonic.
Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
When?
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
You ready?
Takin' a bath.
C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful.
No.  I'm okay.
Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.
Daphne.  Another guy came in asking me about her, too.
Why don't you explain it, Bobby.  Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole in the floor?
Nah, why should you?
Good.  Good.  Commendable.
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
Stay here.
But what if it does?  You might need my help.
This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we?  If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first.
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
You wanna talk to her alone?
I'm serious here.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
Just a shower?
No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
What's your accomplishment.
Is it drug related?
Alright, cut, cut, cut.
Alright.
Hey.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
Stop it.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
Jesus.  And last week you came over with blood on your shoes.  What am I going to do with you?
No.  Tell me what you want to say.
Okay.  Okay.  Hold that thought just for a second.  They only call me when it's an emergency.  Just hold that thought.  Can you call back?
I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
Yeah.  I promise.
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
Thank you.
My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right, Leon?
That's unique.
Keep them out of my way.
Okay.  You ready?
Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
I am butcher.
Dog food.
No.  Are you proposing?
Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
What?  It doesn't work that way.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
Come alone.  Bring cash.  And we'll talk about surrendering.
My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
Tommy, take a walk.
You'll be my first.
Let her go!  Let her go!!
I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you know her?
Where is escort service?
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
Look, man, I don't give a shit if you want sex or not, but you're payin' for my time.
Yes sir.
Please join us.  Come on forward.
No, you're travelling together.  I want to talk to you together.  Hi, how are you?  Can I take a look at your documents?  Are you related?
How long are you planning to stay?
New York's finest.  This is his case.
In here, says he wants a million.
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
Okay.
Okay.
I want to document my trip to America.
Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!
Shut up.
I did.
What does it look like?  It's an address book!
Sit down!
This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.
Cut!
Shut up.  Look!
Bad last moment - I cut it out.
Your idea?  I thought it was my idea.
You think you are a director?  You are a fucking little, small Russian piece of shit.  And I hate you.  I fucking hate you.
No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!
Ha. Ha.
Look at the way we live.  I'm a plumber. You think I'd be working if I had money?!
Yes, the money is good.
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
In love?  With who?
This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
Well, he...
I want to hear everything he said.
That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
New York.
Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
Evidence.  Of a homicide.
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
He's my collar!
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!
Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.
Yeah?
You hear that question, Garcia?
If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
That doesn't apply to me because I'm not a criminal.  I'm not a criminal!  I wasn't convicted.
Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
She's wonderful.
We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
Sure, what is it?
What's up?
It's about my salary cheques.
It's possible.
I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
Yes, I thought so.
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
But not completely inconceivable?
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
Anyway, it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.
No.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
Two more.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
I guess not.
Roger.
What is it, Hal?
Yes, I know.
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
Well, don't worry about it.
Yes, it is, Hal.
Well, that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.
Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on, I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection.
Well, what is it?
Still, you really don't believe it, do you?
Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
Where is Mrs. Brown?
Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Well, how's it going back there?
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
I'll bet it's a fortune.
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Yes, very pleasant.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Fine.
Yes, it's coming along very well.
Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
That's right.
I see.
Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened?
Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill
I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
True.
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
That's true
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
Let me see the tracking alignment display.
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
All right, Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy, please.
I want to pick up my car.
Hammond.
Yeah, I've been busy.
Great, just great.
No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
Here's hoping, baby...
Hey, no, I'm tryin' to be nice. Buy yourself something pretty. I'd do it, but I got to go.  I got this cop waitin' for me...
Now you're talkin'. See ya...
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
He can live or die ... You let us in and he's got a chance to make it.  Otherwise, he gets ventilated.
I don't think you're gonna make it.
I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
Sure, anything you want.
Didn't work out that way.  He busted out with a big Indian. They capped two guards on a road gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
I'll think about it.
Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
Shit.  I'm already sorry.
Luther was part of the gang?
Thank you.
Want to try it again?
Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
Last night, two nights ago, three?
You have a good time?
Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
That's never been one of my problems.
What are you talkin' about?
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.
Must be billy's girl.
Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
They saved your ass, convict.
One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
He's after your money.
Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Yeah.  Right.
...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
That ain't philosophy.  That's common sense.
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
No class...
Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
You stay with me...
So you took the rest of the night off...
Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
You sure that's the reason?
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.
Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.
Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
Partnership?
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
Yeah?
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
I lost them, that's what happened.
I didn't have the time.
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
Hey ... Dick Tracy.
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
Nothing.
Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
What?
I don't know.
When? How?
I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
I still don't think it's loaded.
You're hopeless.
That's the way I see it, too.
What'd you do?
I guess he got the message...
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
I get that. The job first. Everything else, especially me, second. I get it. I don't like it.
Jack?  What was that?
Just a second, that's all!
Fuck you.
Don't.  We've had a hard night.
We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian.
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
How do you know?
Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
Let's go, Reggie.
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
How would you know?
Hey, two days with him is enough.
What the hell's wrong?  I didn't do anything.
Shut up.
What do you want?
Sure, right.
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away...
What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
Don't mess with me. How much?
Try and take it.
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
Why?  What's wrong with me?
Ah, Father... You are so wrong. Let me explain...
No thank you.
That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
She dropped in on me... holding this.
The girl?
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
So you do know her.
Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
What kind of mission?
We have to save the world.
Good luck..
Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?
Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
One more reason to shoot first eh?
This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
What is?
I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part!
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
I didn't know your size.
Perfect.
The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...
They are... with me...
I was talking to the cat.
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
In your dreams! See you tonight!
So, just how big was this fare?
Leeloo..
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
Hi Ma...
I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
Have you pulled yourself together?
...Not yet.
You have nine points left on your license..
Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
Found it?
I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
I didn't have a dad... never saw him... never even heard him. 50 billion people listen to me every day... and he doesn't hear me...
Got it...
He's on vacation.
It's like a cab isn't it?
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?
Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission.
You have won the annual Gemini contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two. Congratulations. Here are your tickets.
I thought you were divorced.
Oh god!
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
You noticed..
Protect life... Until death.
I want to sleep... forever...
...Like love...
Why?... Why would you need me?
I love you...
You right that is bad.. but mathematically luck must change! Grandfather say: "It never rain every day." This is good news guarantee.. I bet you lunch!
Been here long?
You're welcome..
We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.
...What do you mean?
Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
Wait or act.
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
To fame.. salud..
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Got it.
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
Okay, I believe you.
Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
I love you.
Sure.  I'll call the guy.
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
Betty's out of town so we're playing next week.
Why the gun?
I'm not gonna need it.  I won't even wear it.  It's a precaution.  Don't worry about me.
I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me...
It has to be this way for now.  It won't be long.
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
Don't...
Mrs. Christian.
She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
Hmm.
Is it?
I want to watch you work.
If it's not him, there's no deal.
I'd rather you didn't.
What's the problem?
He's in.  It will be his pleasure.
They should be here any minute.
Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?
What are you... ?
I remember him.
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.
Leave him alone.
Fuck off.
First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...
Call me Tom.
Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...
Any good?
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
I know what you did.
What the fuck are you.. ?
I don't know...
I want his name.
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
It was a lot of fucking money.
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
You enjoy it?
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
Where do you think you're taking this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world?  How you gonna do that... ?
Stop talking.
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
I'm listening.
Of what sort?
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
Enlighten me.
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
Good for you.
Three, four years.
There's not much illegal.
I'm not a cop.
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
Four hundred a week, off the books.
See you then.  Oh, and, don't call me "pops."
Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight.
Interesting theory.
Child pornography.
First of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer.  It's too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet.  Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants.  It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em.  But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes.  No one knows where it comes from.  That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth.  Those are zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their hands are permanently pruned.  They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister.  Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes.  Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations.  Interstate wire transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows?  That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal.  There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is.
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
What about me?
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
You're learning.
Where does he sell it?
He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
See ya.
It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?
I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.
He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here...
I'll do whatever I can to help.
You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
Do you want to tell me what you found?
I'm afraid I don't...
I'm telling you it's not that.
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
Okay, I follow you so far...
Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
You're joking.
To the penny.  Exactly one million dollars in cash.
Okay.
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
How are you?  Having any luck?
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
Yes, but...
These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations...  ... fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different.  I'm here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually.  I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh...
Neil... Neil Cole.
Well, I'm following up on your daughter, Mary, height; five four, weight; hundred ten pounds, brown eyes, blonde hair.  Born April 24, 1976.  Missing June 11th, 1992.  A runaway, that's how she's listed. Is this information correct... ?
That's exactly what I am.
You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.
She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
It got to be too much for him.
No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
What?
Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
What... ?
Who are you?
They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
No... no... no...
Those are her belongings.
Her belongings?
That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
No, sir, he is not.
He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
What?
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
I don't want to.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back.
Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
What?
Kristen...
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
Then we'll stay up together.
No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.
You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
I know.
We have matching luggage.
What?
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
"In her dream"?
Look, you know why, you just don't believe me.
The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
Three days.
Alright, I think I see salvation...
Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
Let me talk to you.
Nice neighborhood.
About Freddy?
Honey, we went over this in therapy.
Mother, you've just murdered me.  Take that to your goddamn therapy...
It's okay, babe.  We're with you.
You had a nasty bump.
You don't get it, he's after me...
It's okay, Dan
You're not taking my baby!
It's lonely in there, in my room.
I could tell you were sad.  I just wanted to see if you were all right.
Been having bad dreams.
No...
She doesn't want me around
My friend, with the funny hand.
He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
Jesus!  Don't do that!
Sorry, babe.
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
You're right.
It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
Sobering...
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.
I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
Well we gotta do something!
Yeah.  I'm just aces.
Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
That's their problem.
But I've seen her grave.
My undying love.  Have some.
Who?
All of us.  Right?
Mark...
He invited me to his house last night.
It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
And they thought <u>you</u> could re- place the Skipper?
Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
My father!  He's not - ?
Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
<u>You</u> said it.  But I won't argue -
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
Yes?
Which is the one - we have to worry about?
And his 'egghead' son!  We'll give 'em a <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>, won't we?
But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
Helen.  I appeal to you -
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
So?
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
Reef and I can take the Explorer down, clamp it around the eye, and ---
What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!
Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
You know - it <u>is</u>?
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
Right, Skipper.
Seems to be all around...
I...don't know!
Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
The frogmen?
We hope!
Why do you say that?
Under <u>water</u>?
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
What if the Tiger Shark were to anticipate a bit?  Perhaps be lying there waiting - ?
<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....
It'll be all right.  We're old friends!
Thirty-four seconds!
What?
Nothing we can do, now.
Minus three.
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
Why?
I'll be another!
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
Twombley involved?
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.
How soon?
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
Oh.
I hear Twombley got shot.
This is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up. Twombley's son-in-law and daughter are up the weekend. Didn't you say you'd seen him, Wade?
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
Shit! What are we gonna do?
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
Yeah.
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
Yeah?
Drafted by the Red Sox.
Oh.
They said.
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
Yeah.
Sun's gettin high.
You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems. 
Not here.
Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.
How'd you get the job?
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
Shit.
Piece of fucking cake.
You stayed away?
Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
Sure you did.
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
He sure as hell won't.
I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
Yeah.
Yeah. It's stupid.
Was it funny?
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
It's stupid.
It's fun.
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
Yes.
Jesus, why?
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
Yes.
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
Yes.
Where do you expect to wait for her? Obviously downstairs with the other kids isn't good enough.
Pop?
Oh.
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
Okay.
Fine.
What are you sorry for?
I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.
You can't.
Oh.
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
Don't go playing policeman.
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
Something bugging you?
Yeah. A few things.
Well, right now we're not too interested. Finish up what you gotta do, then you can get bugged on your own time.
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
You? Why?
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
Maybe.
You and Mel Gordon?
Could be.
Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.
Yeah.
She's grown up some, hasn't she?
Let the past be.  I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone.
See. Get your boots.
Hi honey.
Good. Who?
I still don't understand --
For a while.
You okay?
Yeah.
I'm sorry about what I said.
Forget it.
I'm sorry.
Tonight. Let's get together.
Okay.
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose?
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
But not now.
It's nice.
Then... I guess you have to.
I've been thinking about it, that's all.
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
I know your parents.
I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
Of course! I would've heard.
How?
Wade.
You're not using it today?
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your pipes'll freeze.  Wade, would you do that?
Is...? She's dead then?
Can --?
Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.
What the hell are you talking about?
Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
Hold on!
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
What?
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
Aw, c'mon, I was only saying there's something wrong with "Home Made Cooking", that's all. The sign's fine. What it says is wrong.
Marg! You got orders!
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
His office. You mean my old office.
A lesson in work and its rewards. You'll thank me for this one day.  Sally, turn off that TV!
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
Call it what you want.
Twombley.
They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
Huh?
How was she?
Who?
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
Get some sleep.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
Which is?
Then who shot him?
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
Money.
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
That's what you think.
Wade, are you alright?
Well, you aren't the President, dear.
Don't you even want to ask?
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
No, it's okay.  After all, he is the President, right?
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
That's not really the point.
Big secret.  You said the same thing to Newsweek.
Jim... for godsake!
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
Yes. They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails.
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
You read my mind.
He's busy being dead.
I'm doing what I can.
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
Stay cool.
We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
Lemme take a look.
We don't know that.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
Put together a score sheet.  I'll make some calls.
An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
Like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard.
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
Yes, Mr. President.
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
Air Force One, acknowledged.  tNT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP.
Ga get it.
How many others killed?
Any of us?
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
A secret service agent. It must be.
Well it worked.
Stand by.
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
Copy, Air Force One.
This is a remarkable aircraft.
Thank you.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell.
Cooperation. If you try to escape, you will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrade's bodies will prevent you from exiting. Good day.
What do you know of my husband?
Say something dear.
Jim...
Three...
Over my dead body.
Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.
One thing I've learned as
Can't it wait?
How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
Please... don't start with me.
Flying the plane.
Excuse me?
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
Yeah, right.
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.
No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?
I might still have a few chips left.
This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
Did we tape the Duke game?
We'll just say it was in bad taste.
Sir...
Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown.
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
I was reading too.
What's the story?
I was asking McCrosky, Commissioner.
Yes I did...
Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
Dunn.
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here!
And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
If that's the way you want it.
I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
Elaine, I mean the mission has to be aborted.  This ship should never have passed FSA inspection.  This thing is held together by string and chewing gum.
What word would you use, Elaine?
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone.
Ted!
Ted, there's no time to explain.
I mean until we start to burn up.
That was very well put, Ted.
That's right -- premature ejection.
What will happen to him, Ted?
The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.
Set!
What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?
Yes -- last week that pile of mud was only this high.
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
You're heading up the division in charge of babies for Mr. and Mrs. Simon Kurtz.
Simon, why has he become so... so...
He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
Simon, what are you saying?!
I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.
You can do it from up here, Captain.
Negative.
You have great tits.
There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine. What about tonight -- just you and me.  We can be alone.  I can get rid of everyone else on the ship -- I've already proven <u>that</u>.
It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with.
Sure.
What?
You're sure?
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
No.  Poached.  Over.
Anything.  Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him.
We don't have much time.  Let's move. I'll explain everything.
Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
Do you have an appointment, sir?
All right, it's a matter of death.
But that's not a door.  The door's over there.
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing.
No.  I mean your relationship.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.
That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me.
Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.
I'm doing everything I can! -- And stop calling me Shirley!
And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."
Excuse me, Doc, I've got a plane to land.
I can't tell.
No, I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
Well...
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
I just don't want to go over it any more.
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
It's too late, Ted. When I get back to Chicago, I'm going to start my life all over again. I'm sorry.
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now.
I love you, Elaine.
I love you.
It's a big building where the generals meet. But that's not important right now. They've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid. Isn't that good news?
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp.
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
You promise you'll write.
Every day.
Good-bye, darling.
Good-bye, darling.
Yes, Captain?
Did you decide on a runway yet?
You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.
Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.
Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!
I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
Okay, this is one of my favorites.
I will, but Jim won't.
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
No, why don't you take care ot it?
Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
Of course.
Thank you.
Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
The cockpit? What is it?
Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.
Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
Sergeant... Detective.  I wasn't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet.
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
He didn't recognize me.
This is getting out of hand.  I want you to deal with it.  Immediately.
Do it!
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
The murder at the mini-mart is not our case.  The Captain said--
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
Nothing.
And that fits?
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
Did you learn anything?
He has not been home since that day. But she told me where to find him.
But I-- .
I'll handle it.
Stay back!  I'm okay.
From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.
Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.
My wife?  She worries about me.
You are married?
Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not sure I'm gonna go.  She doesn't need her burn-out of a father there...
Sticking out of his ass... yeah! See, that's what makes it a joke. There's like a surprise, and your mind fills in the funny picture. Here's this guy with a pen stuck in his ass and he thinks it's a thermometer.  Nada, huh?
Ta ss'trakyona'...
Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
She's very progressive.  I'm certain she's considering it.
Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!
Why?
Please, I must get out here.
Stop the car!
... and Porter ran a piece of shit mom-and-pop mini-mart.  So what the hell's the connection?
You must leave me alone on this.
We?  You've taken it?
We all did.
Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
Stay out of this, Matthew.  Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall.
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else.
The human?
Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.
That's the way these people are. You don't hit both pumps you just piss them off.
Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
You?
It is. 
What?
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
Yeah, that's comforting.  Mine, too.
I'll cover you!  Get outta there!!
Would you, Sir?
Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
Position?
I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours.  The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers.  About equal to ten megatons.
See you soon.
Well, thanks, I --
I get the picture.
Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
That's right.
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
That's the plan.  My word on it.
Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.
Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
Sorry to disappoint you.
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
Thirty-eight...simulated.
Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
Proceed inside.
Shut up.  Just shut up!
They're but off!  Do something!
Sir?
What's the question?
How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
...We're coming in.
Unknown.  But, it looks like all of them.  Over at the processing station...sublevel 'C' under the south tower.
Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
Poor bastard.
That's right.  So we put up welded barricades at these intersections...  ...and seal these ducts here and here.  Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here.
On my way.
If it comes to that, I'll do us both.  Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations.
Stand back.
No.  Have you?
Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?
No.  No!  It ain't you.  They're inside.  Inside the perimeter. They're in here.
The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --
Uh, what's next?
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
Think of what?  We're fucked.
What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end.  Why can't we use that?
Seal the door.
I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!
They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing?
Can't be.  That's inside the room!
There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
So what do I tell this guy?
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
How long have I been on Gateway station?
No.. I've slept enough.
What about me?
You don't have to be sorry.  It wasn't your fault.
Why do they tell little kids that?
Did one of those things grow inside her?
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
Wah...?  Where are...?
Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in trouble.
Look!
Sure.  Go left.
Newt, wait!
Can we dream?
That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock!  Like I said.
Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.
Sweet Jesus.
Certainly!
Good morning.
Yes.
In a harem.
Oh!
A Turkish brothel.
What?
The marriage!
Well, what does it matter to you?
Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn.
What?
I'm so relieved.
Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
Sir -
And how will you make him keep it?
Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
Then try harder, Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service and learn your place. Go now.
I've come to dinnnnnner!
Are you drunk? You invited me. And my horse. Here he is. Ottavio!
Oh shut up. I'm sick to death of that tune.
Why?
I am! I am! I'm stopping it - slowly. You see! Look, I've stopped. Now we are going back.
Where?
We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
That's stupid.
Do you think that's funny?
No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
No, I'm not playing this game.
No!
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
Tub - but i-tub - but I vol - love but I love ui - You. I love you!
They'll come anyway. They love me here.
Well, don't do that again!
How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
Don't be stupid.
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
This isn't pride. It's sheer stupidity!
No!
I love you! I love you!
He's not Herr Mozart. Call him Papa.
Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?
Wolfi!
Oh, damn!
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
Oh, Stanzi.
It's killing me.
How charming.  But why did he not come himself?
He's terribly busy, sir.
Really?
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
Then he didn't send you?
Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!
Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
What for?
Some service deserves service in return. No?
What do you mean?
Isn't it obvious?
What?
I was at hand.
He needs me, ma'am.
He asked me to stay.
And I'm asking you -
Where's our friend?
I hope so. I need it immediately.
Leave him alone!
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
In three months! Papa.
Well, this is none of your business.  Whoever sent you is going to pay, no?
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!
You can't be Herr Mozart!
Michael!
Ah, now! Here she comes.
It's just a trifle, of course.
May I try it?
Majesty.
You do me too much honour, Sire.
Let's have some fun.  Bring in Herr Mozart, please. But slowly, slowly. I need a minute to practice.
Ah-ha!
Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.
I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
Well, look at them.
Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -
What? On one hearing only?
And German?
So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
What do you mean, Sire?
Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?
What is it?
May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.
Yes, Sire.
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
Who told you this, Majesty?
Well, yes, I admit it is.
But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
Well. There it is.
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
I will.
Am I not welcome?
Of course, welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa!
Don't you have a maid?
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
Pupils?
Yes.
Oh, let's not talk about it.
This is just a game, Papa.
Papa!
No one calls you that.
Yes, thank you, sir.
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
What medicine?
I don't know. He has pains.
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
Are you sure it's an opera?
Are you Herr Mozart?
Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
Sublime! Utterly sublime!
I liked the horse.
Animals?
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
So there you are. What do you say?
Put it down!
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
Yes.
Because there's nothing to see.
