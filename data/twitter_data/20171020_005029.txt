so... the media coverage of richard spencer is starting to feel as ubiquitous as trump coverage in 2015/2016, which is probably not good.
you started out covering him like a celebrity, and this has continued since charlottesville, which... maybe y'all should do better.

the fact that kelly attacked someone for accurately conveying the hurt of a gold star family is really not making its way into the coverage.

@jwgop don't watch fox news for the next few weeks. this uranium one conspiracy is just whataboutism on a new level.
@notlenz that's it. all 12. nicely done.
@reesecommabill oh wow lol kinda got lucky on the portuguese teams
general kelly acted presidential today. he acted like a leader and a father. maybe he should give trump some lessons.
@hardballchris no. this is a really bad take. unless you are saying that he's trump's kind of "presidential" where he attacks black women.
after this particularly gross day, can we shed our red- &amp; blue-colored glasses for a moment to see what we've let happen to our politics?

@realdonaldtrump @jaketapper @ac360 all those people that were tearing up for gen kelly - please sit down. @tarasetmayer
probably a bad time to mention i have a book i co-authored on joe maddon coming out in the spring: 'try not to suck' though they did tonight
@espnchicubs they just didn't try hard enough tonight
all bad people/abusers/predators are products of nasty experiences/upbringing. if we reject their cry for help, it only hurts us more
when i see ppl in my community admit to being predators, it's natural to want to shame them into eternal solitary confinement &amp; isolation
also tonight two mormon missionaries came to my door and we talked about geology and traveling for like 45 minutes
i politely explained that i'm an atheist but i also believe in letting people make their own religious decisions and they were chill with it
